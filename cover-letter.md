**Cover letter for the research prize of the Swiss Society of Cardiology**

Dear Members of the Prize Jury,

I am honored to submit my application for the 2025 Research Prize of the Swiss Society of Cardiology. As a cardiology resident in training and PhD candidate at the University of Fribourg under the supervision of Professor Stéphane Cook, I am submitting my original research work entitled "Disparities in STEMI Diagnosis and Management Among Patients with Mental Health Conditions: The PSYFAST Study," which has been accepted for publication in the European Heart Journal Quality of Care and Clinical Outcomes and will be presented as a moderated poster at the ESC Congress on August 31, 2025.


This submitted work represents a cornerstone of my doctoral thesis, which systematically investigates disparities in STEMI care among understudied and vulnerable populations. My research program focuses on patients who have been historically underrepresented in cardiovascular trials, including those with mental health conditions, cancer patients, the elderly, the young, and patients with circumflex artery occlusions—what I term the "forgotten coronary artery" due to its diagnostic challenges and specific mortality patterns. Through this comprehensive approach, I aim to ensure that Swiss cardiovascular care truly serves all patients equitably, regardless of their comorbidities or presentation characteristics.


The PSYFAST study represents the first comprehensive analysis demonstrating that diagnostic delays in STEMI patients with mental health conditions are directly linked to human bias and result in measurably worse clinical outcomes. Analyzing data from 1,208 patients in the EVALFAST registry over 16 years, we discovered that patients with documented mental health conditions experienced delays of 16.4 minutes from first medical contact to STEMI diagnosis, resulting in peak CK-MB levels that were 71.3 U/L higher, indicating substantially larger infarct sizes. These delays were associated with an 82% increased risk of 30-day major adverse cardiac events and a two-fold increased risk of 5-year cardiovascular death. Most critically, we found no delays after STEMI diagnosis was confirmed, providing evidence that implicit bias occurs specifically at the initial triage stage rather than during interventional treatment—a finding that has immediate and actionable implications for emergency protocols across Switzerland.



This research has already gained significant recognition in the cardiovascular community. I presented these findings at the prestigious EuroPCR conference in Paris in May 2025 during the special session on "STEMI in Special Patient Populations," where they generated substantial discussion about the need for bias-aware triage protocols. Additionally, I presented this work at the Swiss Society of Cardiology Congress in the abstract session, where Swiss colleagues expressed strong interest in implementing our findings in their own centers. The selection of this work for a moderated poster presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress on August 31 in Madrid further validates its international relevance and impact.


My commitment to understanding healthcare disparities in STEMI care extends beyond this single study. I currently have multiple manuscripts under review at leading cardiovascular journals, including a paper on STEMI outcomes in cancer patients submitted to JACC: Advances, and an analysis of the specific mortality patterns associated with circumflex artery occlusions submitted to the International Journal of Cardiology. I am also preparing manuscripts examining age-related disparities, comparing both elderly patients over 80 years and young patients under 40 years with middle-aged STEMI patients—work that will complete my doctoral thesis's comprehensive examination of vulnerable populations in acute cardiac care.


I am deeply committed to ensuring that excellence in Swiss cardiovascular care extends to all patients, particularly those who face additional barriers due to mental health conditions, age extremes, cancer, or anatomical factors. My doctoral work under Professor Cook has reinforced my conviction that addressing these disparities is not merely a research interest but a moral imperative for Swiss medicine. The intersection of vulnerable populations and cardiovascular disease represents a critical area where Switzerland, with its strong research infrastructure and commitment to universal healthcare, can lead international efforts to ensure truly equitable care.


Upon completion of my PhD thesis with these population-based studies, my research trajectory will evolve toward pioneering new approaches in interventional cardiology, specifically focusing on drug-coated balloon (DCB) technology. I aim to participate in creating a large national multicenter registry for drug-coated balloon angioplasty in de novo coronary disease with systematic follow-up, uniting data from Lucerne, Fribourg, and Geneva. This ambitious project builds on the infrastructure I have already established at Fribourg, where I personally implemented the DCB registry, and leverages existing data from Lucerne, where ethics committee approval has already been secured for the multicenter collaboration.

My commitment to advancing DCB research is already demonstrating tangible results. I currently have a manuscript under minor revision at Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions entitled "Coronary Angiography-derived Murray Law-Based Quantitative Flow Ratio (μQFR) After De Novo Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty," which represents a novel approach to understanding coronary physiology following DCB intervention. Additionally, I am supervising a master's student conducting a deep analysis of anatomical and physiological changes pre- and post-DCB with long-term angiographic follow-up—work that is currently in progress. These efforts position Switzerland at the forefront of physiological assessment in DCB-treated vessels, an area that remains critically understudied despite the growing adoption of this technology.

Starting in November 2025, I will continue my cardiology training at Geneva University Hospital under the mentorship of PD Dr. Juan Iglesias, where I plan to establish the Geneva arm of this registry. The combination of data from Geneva, Lucerne, and Fribourg will encompass hopefully more than 3,000 patients, creating what will likely one of the world's most comprehensive registry of drug-coated balloon angioplasty for de novo coronary disease with systematic follow-up. This registry will not only advance our understanding of DCB efficacy.

The CHF 30,000 prize would be strategically allocated to transform both my current research on vulnerable populations and my future DCB registry into internationally recognized Swiss contributions to cardiovascular medicine. Specifically, I would use the funds for:

1. Conference participation and dissemination : Attending and presenting my research at major international conferences including ESC, TCT, EuroPCR, and ACC, ensuring that Swiss innovations in equitable cardiac care and DCB technology reach the global cardiovascular community.
2. Geneva registry implementation : Establishing the Geneva arm of the national DCB registry, including secure data storage infrastructure and partial funding for a study nurse to obtain patient consent and coordinate systematic follow-up. This investment would leverage the existing infrastructure in Lucerne and Fribourg to create a truly national resource that could help better assessing long-term DCB outcomes.

This Research Prize would enable me to complete two interconnected work : ensuring equitable access to life-saving interventions for all patients regardless of their vulnerabilities, and advancing innovative technologies like drug-coated balloons through rigorous, large-scale research. By supporting my work, the Swiss Society of Cardiology would be investing not only in addressing current healthcare disparities but also in creating strong, long term collaboration between Swiss centers.

I am grateful for your consideration of my application and would be deeply honored to continue this vital research with the support of the Swiss Society of Cardiology and Amgen Switzerland AG. This prize would accelerate both streams of my research, establishing Switzerland as the standard-bearer for both equitable and innovative cardiovascular care on the international stage.

Sincerely,
