  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adopting lifestyle interventions is pivotal in coronary artery disease (CAD) management and prevention to amplify cardiovascular and mental  well-being. This study aims to quantify the effect of mindfulness-based  interventions (MBIs) on anxiety, depression and stress in CAD patients. METHODS:  A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was  conducted by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, and  Science Direct) through December 2023. The risk of bias was assessed using the  PEDro tool, and the study outcomes were expressed as standard mean difference at  95\% CI. RESULTS: Out of 1838 yielded results, eight RCTs involving 623  participants with a mean age of 56.96\,{\textpm}\,4.89 met the prespecified eligibility  criteria. The pooled results showed a statistically significant and beneficial  effect of MBIs on CAD patients' mental health status in regards to anxiety  (SMD\,=\,-0.83; 95\% CI [-1.19, -0.46], p\,{$<$}\,0.001), depression (SMD\,=\,- 0.86; 95\% CI  [-1.14, -0.58], p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and stress (SMD\,=\,-0.69; 95\% CI [-1.27, -0.12],  p\,=\,0.02). The subgroup sensitivity analyses based on the region (Asia vs.  Europe) indicated a statistically non-significant subgroup effect of MBIs on  anxiety (I (2)\,=\,63.9\%, p\,=\,0.10) and depression (I (2)\,=\,25.8\%, p\,=\,0.25), and a  significant effect on stress (I (2)\,=\,80.0\%, p\,=\,0.03). Although the  methodological quality of the trials was generally satisfactory, all studies  lacked allocation concealment and blinding. Additionally, gender imbalances, and  inadequate follow-up may have potentially compromised the validity of the trials.  CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based interventions are beneficial for improving CAD  patients' anxiety, depression and stress symptoms. Nevertheless, it is imperative  to conduct more rigorous and robust studies with an equal gender ratio and  long-term follow-up.},

We describe 5 patients with cardiogenic shock and severe aortic stenosis who received an axillary microaxial pump (Impella) as an extended bridge to transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The median (range) age was 65 (61-87) years old, 80\% were male, and 80\% presented with stage D or E cardiogenic shock. In most cases, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed prior to pump insertion. Stabilization by Impella allowed for heart team evaluation and additional interventions, including percutaneous coronary intervention, MitraClip, and cardioversion. After a median (range) of 7 (5-14) days of Impella support, semi-elective transcatheter aortic valve replacement was successfully performed. All patients survived to discharge. Four patients (80\%) were alive beyond 1 year. In these high-risk patients, prolonged support with a microaxial pump allowed for stabilization, ancillary interventions, and multi-disciplinary heart team evaluation prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement.},

  abstract = {Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common form of valvular heart disease in the developed world, with a rising prevalence due to an ageing Australian population. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) offers a less invasive option for the treatment of severe AS, with evidence supporting TAVI compared with medical therapy in inoperable patients and superior with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in high-risk patients. Equal outcomes have been observed in all-comer intermediate-risk populations. The Heart Team utilises a shared decision-making approach between physicians and surgeons in risk-stratifying patients and reduces the intrinsic bias that may occur if decisions are made in isolation. Geriatric assessment is useful for identifying preoperative frailty, a major risk factor for death post-aortic valve intervention. In severe AS, a decision can be made collaboratively to pursue TAVI, SAVR, a Ross Procedure or conservative management. The learning curve associated with TAVI has improved markedly, with overall complication rates decreasing around the world. Contemporary changes in practice, such as conscious sedation without general anaesthesia, expedited recovery and early discharge, will likely improve cost-effectiveness. In 2018, TAVI is a well-established procedure in Australia that has revolutionised the management of severe AS. In the future, with an expanding elderly population, the number of patients to benefit from transcatheter therapies for severe AS is hypothesised to increase 4-10-fold. Heart Team assessment is crucial in patients with severe AS to direct appropriate management.},

Cardiac rehabilitation is a class Ia recommendation of  the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology after  myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization, promotes the ABCS along with  lifestyle counseling and exercise, and is associated with decreased total  mortality, cardiac mortality, and rehospitalizations. However, current  participation rates for CR in the United States generally range from only 20\% to  30\%. This road map focuses on interventions, such as electronic medical  record-based prompts and staffing liaisons that increase referrals of appropriate  patients to CR, increase enrollment of appropriate individuals into CR, and  increase adherence to longer-term CR. We also calculate that increasing CR  participation from 20\% to 70\% would save 25,000 lives and prevent 180,000  hospitalizations annually in the United States.},

The goal of this study  was to determine demographic, medical, and psychosocial predictors of outpatient  cardiac rehabilitation participation in hospitalized older post--coronary event  patients. METHODS: An in-hospital-guided interview was performed by the clinical  research nurse of the cardiac rehabilitation program with 226 hospitalized  patients, aged 62 years and older, who had recently suffered a myocardial  infarction or coronary bypass surgery. Demographic, medical, and psychosocial  data were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall cardiac rehabilitation participation rate in  a population with a mean age of 70.4 +/- 6 years (range, 62 to 92 years) was 21\%.  By multivariate analysis, the strength of the primary physician's recommendation  for participation was the most powerful predictor of cardiac rehabilitation  entry. Also, significant predictors of participation included commute time,  patient "denial" of severity of illness, and history of depression. Medical  factors such as cardiac diagnosis and left ventricular ejection fraction did not  predict participation. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, medical, and psychosocial data,  collected in hospitalized post-coronary event patients are powerful predictors of  subsequent participation in cardiac rehabilitation.},

As a consequence, a new subspecialty of 'Interventional Imaging' for SHD interventions and a new dedicated professional figure, the 'Interventional Imager' with specific competencies has emerged. The interventional imager is an integral part of the heart team and plays a central role in decision-making throughout the patient pathway, including the appropriateness and feasibility of a procedure, pre-procedural planning, intra-procedural guidance, and post-procedural follow-up. However, inherent challenges exist to develop a training programme for SHD imaging that differs from traditional cardiovascular imaging pathways. The purpose of this document is to provide the standard requirements for the training in SHD imaging, as well as a starting point for an official certification process for SHD interventional imager.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor and prasugrel provide stronger platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel. Direct pharmacodynamic comparison between them has not yet been reported in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective, single-center, single-blind study, 55 out of 117 (47\%) screened consecutive ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to either ticagrelor 180 mg loading followed by 90 mg bid, or prasugrel 60 mg loading followed by 10 mg od for 5 days. Platelet reactivity (PR) was assessed with the VerifyNow P2Y12 function assay and the Multiplate Analyzer at 0, 1, 2, 6, 24 hours, and 5 days postrandomization. The primary end point, PR with VerifyNow at hour 1, did not differ significantly between patients randomized to ticagrelor versus prasugrel (257.3 P2Y12 reaction unit [PRU], 95\% CI 230.8-283.8 versus 231.3 PRU, 95\% CI 205.3-257.4; P=0.2). PR did not differ at 2, 6, and 24 hours, although at day 5 it was lower with ticagrelor than prasugrel (25.6 PRU, 95\% CI 12.3-38.9 versus 50.3 PRU, 95\% CI 36.4-64.1; P=0.01). At hour 2, high on-treatment PR rates (cutoff 208 PRU) were 46.2\% and 34.6\% for ticagrelor and prasugrel, respectively, decreased significantly thereafter, whereas did not differ significantly between the 2 agents at all the time points of the study. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, both ticagrelor and prasugrel exhibit an initial delay in the onset of their antiplatelet action. Ticagrelor did not appear superior to prasugrel in reducing PR during the first 24 hours of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction.

It is a rare but important cause of unilateral-pleural effusion. The prevalence of this complication is 5-10\% of the total number of patients with advanced stages of cirrhosis. In most cases (85\%), the effusion is right-sided; however, in 13\% of cases it can be left-sided and bilateral in 2\% of the cases. We present a case of left-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by the biopsy;the patient didn't have any history or any signs or symptoms of cirrhosis prior to her presentation. In the case described, the patient was treated with spirnolactone, furosemide and ursodeoxycholic acid. At follow-up after six months since the diagnosis, she was responding to treatment with no complications. This case emphasizes the importance of considering hepatic hydrothorax as an etiology of a transudative pleural effusion regardless of the presence or absence of ascites inpatients with occult cirrhosis.},

We aimed to examine the association between the coronary artery involved and the in-hospital mortality in patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) after ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: The in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients who underwent pPCI was assessed at the Department of Cardiology, Harzklinik Goslar, Germany, which has no access to immediate mechanical circulatory support (MCS), between 2013 and 2017. RESULTS: We enrolled 312 STEMI patients, with a~mean age of 67.1~{\textpm} 13.4~years, of whom 211 (68\%) were male. In-hospital mortality was documented in 31~patients (10\%). In-hospital mortality was associated with pre-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; n~= 39/12.5\%), older age, lower systolic blood pressure, Killip class~{$>$} 1,~triple-vessel disease (each p~{$<$} 0.0001), female gender (p~= 0.0158), and with the localization of the treated culprit lesion in the left main coronary artery (LMCA; p~= 0.0083) and in the ramus circumflexus (RCX; p~= 0.0141). CONCLUSION: In this monocentric cohort, all-cause in-hospital mortality of STEMI patients after pPCI was significantly higher in those patients with culprit lesions in the LMCA and in the RCX, which may prove to be a~substantial novel risk factor for STEMI-related mortality. Increasing age and female gender may be interdependent risk factors for mortality in this patient population. Furthermore, our data highlight the importance of the availability of MCS options in pPCI centers for patients after CPR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is most commonly guided by angiography alone. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance has been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after PCI, principally by resulting in a larger postprocedure lumen than with angiographic guidance. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides higher resolution imaging than does IVUS, although findings from some studies suggest that it might lead to smaller luminal diameters after stent implantation. We sought to establish whether or not a novel OCT-based stent sizing strategy would result in a minimum stent area similar to or better than that achieved with IVUS guidance and better than that achieved with angiography guidance alone. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older undergoing PCI from 29 hospitals in eight countries. Eligible patients had one or more target lesions located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated reference vessel diameter of 2{$\cdot$}25-3{$\cdot$}50 mm and a length of less than 40 mm. We excluded patients with left main or ostial right coronary artery stenoses, bypass graft stenoses, chronic total occlusions, planned two-stent bifurcations, and in-stent restenosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1; with use of an interactive web-based system in block sizes of three, stratified by site) to OCT guidance, IVUS guidance, or angiography-guided stent implantation. We did OCT-guided PCI using a specific protocol to establish stent length, diameter, and expansion according to reference segment external elastic lamina measurements. All patients underwent final OCT imaging (operators in the IVUS and angiography groups were masked to the OCT images). The primary efficacy endpoint was post-PCI minimum stent area, measured by OCT at a masked independent core laboratory at completion of enrolment, in all randomly allocated participants who had primary outcome data. The primary safety endpoint was procedural MACE. We tested non-inferiority of OCT guidance to IVUS guidance (with a non-inferiority margin of 1{$\cdot$}0 mm(2)), superiority of OCT guidance to angiography guidance, and superiority of OCT guidance to IVUS guidance, in a hierarchical manner. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02471586. FINDINGS: Between May 13, 2015, and April 5, 2016, we randomly allocated 450 patients (158 [35\%] to OCT, 146 [32\%] to IVUS, and 146 [32\%] to angiography), with 415 final OCT acquisitions analysed for the primary endpoint (140 [34\%] in the OCT group, 135 [33\%] in the IVUS group, and 140 [34\%] in the angiography group). The final median minimum stent area was 5{$\cdot$}79 mm(2) (IQR 4{$\cdot$}54-7{$\cdot$}34) with OCT guidance, 5{$\cdot$}89 mm(2) (4{$\cdot$}67-7{$\cdot$}80) with IVUS guidance, and 5{$\cdot$}49 mm(2) (4{$\cdot$}39-6{$\cdot$}59) with angiography guidance. OCT guidance was non-inferior to IVUS guidance (one-sided 97{$\cdot$}5\% lower CI -0{$\cdot$}70 mm(2); p=0{$\cdot$}001), but not superior (p=0{$\cdot$}42). OCT guidance was also not superior to angiography guidance (p=0{$\cdot$}12). We noted procedural MACE in four (3\%) of 158 patients in the OCT group, one (1\%) of 146 in the IVUS group, and one (1\%) of 146 in the angiography group (OCT vs IVUS p=0{$\cdot$}37; OCT vs angiography p=0{$\cdot$}37). INTERPRETATION: OCT-guided PCI using a specific reference segment external elastic lamina-based stent optimisation strategy was safe and resulted in similar minimum stent area to that of IVUS-guided PCI. These data warrant a large-scale randomised trial to establish whether or not OCT guidance results in superior clinical outcomes to angiography guidance. FUNDING: St Jude Medical.},

  abstract = {Acute circulatory collapse may rarely occur during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). In such cases, immediate mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as a bridge to remedial interventions may be required. To define the rate of MCS utilization in TAVI patients and identify the predictors of MCS utilization in a cohort of TAVI patients. TAVI patients between January 2012 and September 2015 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) by using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. Trend weights were used to generate the national estimates of MCS rate in TAVI. Multivariate regression analysis was done to identify predictors of MCS use. A total 60,985 patients underwent TAVI with 1,695 patients receiving MCS (2.8\%) during index hospitalization. The most common type of MCS was intra-aortic balloon pump in 52\%, followed by extra corporeal membrane oxygenator in 34\%, then percutaneous ventricular assist device in 7.4\%. Rate of MCS use declined over the study period from 3\% in 2012 (Q1) to 1.8\% in 2015 (Q3). The use of MCS during TAVI was associated with 10-fold increase in-hospital mortality (27.1\% vs 2.8\%, p {$<$}0.001). Predictors of MCS were congestive heart failure (OR\,=\,2.58, p {$<$}0.001), transapical access (OR\,=\,1.92, p {$<$}0.001), respiratory complication (OR\,=\,5.19, p {$<$}0.001), acute myocardial infarction (OR\,=\,4.21, p {$<$}0.001), cardiac arrest (OR\,=\,10.65, p {$<$}0.001), and cardiogenic shock (OR\,=\,19.09, p {$<$}0.001). In conclusion, the rate of MCS during TAVI hospitalization in the United States declined between 2012 and 2015. MCS during TAVI was associated with a 10-fold increase in in-hospital mortality.},

Although TAVI is associated with low mortality of 1.2-6.5\%, cardiogenic shock (CS) as a peri-interventional complication remains a challenging problem with very high morbidity and mortality. AIM: This study evaluated the clinical outcome of the use of Impella ventricular assist device in patients undergoing TAVI. METHODS: Between 11/2015 and 08/2018, all patients undergoing TAVI requiring temporary circulatory during the same index hospitalization were included. Primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were peri-interventional mortality and 30-day stroke rate. RESULTS: Of the 390 patients undergoing TAVI, 13 (3\%) required hemodynamic support with an Impella device. Of these, 3 (23\%) underwent protected high-risk PCI before TAVI and 10 patients (77\%) needed emergency periprocedural hemodynamic support due to cardiogenic shock. Mortality at 30\,days was 0\% in Impella-protected PCI and 40\% with Impella use for periprocedural CS. No stroke occurred in the cohort up to 30\,days. Insertion of the Impella device in the setting of TAVI was fast with a mean insertion time of 10 min. Eight patients (80\%) in the periprocedural CS group required cardiopulmonary resuscitation prior to Impella use. There was only one device-related complication. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary hemodynamic support with the Impella device in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis or in CS secondary to complicated TAVI was technically doable and allowed stabilization and treatment of salvageable patients.},

Little is known about the outcome of patients with LCx infarct-related acute IWMI. Recently, studies have shown that LCx-related infarcts carried less favorable outcome. Materials and Methods: Between January 2007 and December 2012, data of all patients with acute IWMI, who presented to a university hospital in Saudi Arabia were reviewed, and the various in-hospital outcomes were compared. Results: A total of 90 patients comprising 63 (70\%) patients in the RCA-related IWMI group and 27 (30\%) in the LCx-related IWMI group were reviewed. Diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and renal impairment were more prevalent in the RCA-related infarct group. The prevalence of atrio-ventricular block (14.3\% vs. 0\%, P = 0.053) and the frequency of cardiogenic shock needing inotropic support (14.3\% vs. 0\%, P = 0.053) were higher in the RCA related infarcts. Conclusions: Our study showed that in a sample from Saudi Arabia, the in-hospital prognostic outcomes were less favorable in patients with RCA-related acute IWMI when compared to LCx-related infarcts.},

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to update the Cochrane systematic  review and meta-analysis of exercise-based CR for CHD. METHODS: The Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science  Citation Index Expanded were searched to July 2014. Retrieved papers, systematic  reviews, and trial registries were hand-searched. We included randomized  controlled trials with at least 6 months of follow-up, comparing CR to  no-exercise controls following myocardial infarction or revascularization, or  with a diagnosis of angina pectoris or CHD defined by angiography. Two authors  screened titles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Studies  were pooled using random effects meta-analysis, and stratified analyses were  undertaken to examine potential treatment effect modifiers. RESULTS: A total of  63 studies with 14,486 participants with median follow-up of 12 months were  included. Overall, CR led to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (relative  risk: 0.74; 95\% confidence interval: 0.64 to 0.86) and the risk of hospital  admissions (relative risk: 0.82; 95\% confidence interval: 0.70 to 0.96). There  was no significant effect on total mortality, myocardial infarction, or  revascularization. The majority of studies (14 of 20) showed higher levels of  health-related quality of life in 1 or more domains following exercise-based CR  compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that  exercise-based CR reduces cardiovascular mortality and provides important data  showing reductions in hospital admissions and improvements in quality of life.  These benefits appear to be consistent across patients and intervention types and  were independent of study quality, setting, and publication date.},

FFR computed tomography (CT) derived (FFR(CT)) has shown to be accurate, but its clinical usefulness in patients with complex coronary artery disease remains to be investigated. The present study sought to determine the impact of FFR(CT) on heart team's treatment decision-making and selection of vessels for revascularization in patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease. METHODS: The trial was an international, multicenter study randomizing 2 heart teams to make a treatment decision between percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass grafting using either coronary computed tomography angiography or conventional angiography. The heart teams received the FFR(CT) and had to make a treatment decision and planning integrating the functional component of the stenoses. Each heart team calculated the anatomic SYNTAX score, the noninvasive functional SYNTAX score and subsequently integrated the clinical information to compute the SYNTAX score III providing a treatment recommendation, that is, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, or equipoise coronary artery bypass grafting-percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary objective was to determine the proportion of patients in whom FFR(CT) changed the treatment decision and planning. RESULTS: Overall, 223 patients were included. Coronary computed tomography angiography assessment was feasible in 99\% of the patients and FFR(CT) analysis in 88\%. FFR(CT) was available for 1030 lesions (mean FFR(CT) value 0.64{\textpm}13). A treatment recommendation of coronary artery bypass grafting was made in 24\% of the patients with coronary computed tomography angiography with FFR(CT). The addition of FFR(CT) changed the treatment decision in 7\% of the patients and modified selection of vessels for revascularization in 12\%. With conventional angiography as reference, FFR(CT) assessment resulted in reclassification of 14\% of patients from intermediate and high to low SYNTAX score tertile. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease, a noninvasive physiology assessment using FFR(CT) changed heart team's treatment decision-making and procedural planning in one-fifth of the patients.

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the effects of ``prolonged'' antiplatelet therapy (that is, given for one month or more) on ``vascular events'' (non-fatal myocardial infarctions, non-fatal strokes, or vascular deaths) in various categories of patients. Design: Overviews of 145 randomised trials of ``prolonged'' antiplatelet therapy versus control and 29 randomised comparisons between such antiplatelet regimens. Setting: Randomised trials that could have been available by March 1990. Subjects: Trials of antiplatelet therapy versus control included about 70 000 ``high risk'' patients (that is, with some vascular disease or other condition implying an increased risk of occlusive vascular disease) and 30 000 ``low risk'' subjects from the general population. Direct comparisons of different antiplatelet regimens involved about 10 000 high risk patients. Results: In each of four main high risk categories of patients antiplatelet therapy was definitely protective. The percentages of patients suffering a vascular event among those allocated antiplatelet therapy versus appropriately adjusted control percentages (and mean scheduled treatment durations and net absolute benefits) were: (a) among about 20 000 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 10\% antiplatelet therapy v 14\% control (one month benefit about 40 vascular events avoided per 1000 patients treated (2P\&lt; 0.00001)); (b) among about 20 000 patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, 13\% antiplatelet therapy v 17\% control (two year benefit about 40/1000 (2P\&lt;0.00001)); (c) among about 10 000 patients with a past history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 18\% antiplatelet therapy v 22\% control (three year benefit about 40/1000 (2P\&lt;0.00001)); (d) among about 20 000 patients with some other relevant medical history (unstable angina, stable angina, vascular surgery, angioplasty, atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, peripheral vascular disease, etc), 9\% v 14\% in 4000 patients with unstable angina (six month benefit about 50/1000 (2P\&lt;0.00001)) and 6\% v 8\% in 16 000 other high risk patients (one year benefit about 20/1000 (2P\&lt;0.00001)). Reductions in vascular events were about one quarter in each of these four main categories and were separately statistically significant in middle age and old age, in men and women, in hypertensive and normotensive patients, and in diabetic and non: diabetic patients. Taking all high risk patients together showed reductions of about one third in non-fatal myocardial infarction, about one third in non-fatal stroke, and about one sixth in vascular death (each 2P\&lt;0.00001). There was no evidence that non-vascular deaths were increased, so in each of the four main high risk categories overall mortality was significantly reduced. The most widely tested antiplatelet regimen was ``medium dose'' (75-325 mg/day) aspirin. Doses throughout this range seemed similarly effective (although in an acute emergency it might be prudent to use an initial dose of 160-325 mg rather than about 75 mg). There was no appreciable evidence that either a higher aspirin dose or any other antiplatelet regimen was more effective than medium dose aspirin in preventing vascular events. The optimal duration of treatment for patients with a past history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack could not be determined directly because most trials lasted only one, two, or three years (average about two years). Nevertheless, there was significant (2P\&lt;0.00001) further benefit between the end of year 1 and the end of year 3, suggesting that longer treatment might well be more effective. Among low risk recipients of ``primary prevention'' a significant reduction of one third in non: fatal myocardial infarction was, however, accompanied by a non-significant increase in stroke. Furthermore, the absolute reduction in vascular events was much smaller than for high risk patients despite a much longer treatment period (4.4\% antiplatelet therapy v 4.8\% control; five year benefit only about four per 1000 patients treated) an was not significant (2P=0.09). Conclusions: Among a much wider range of patients at high risk of occlusive vascular disease than is currently treated routinely, some years of antiplatelet therapy - with aspirin 75-325 mg/day or some other antiplatelet regimen (provided there are no contraindications) - offers worthwhile protection against myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Significant benefit is evident not only among patients with unstable angina, suspected acute myocardial infarction, or a past history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack, but also among many other categories of high risk patients (such as those having vascular procedures and those with stable angina or peripheral vascular disease). There is as yet, however, no clear evidence on the balance of risks and benefits of antiplatelet therapy in primary prevention among low risk subjects.}

We sought to determine the prognostic value of low platelet reactivity (LPR), optimal platelet reactivity (OPR), or high platelet reactivity (HPR) by applying uniform cut-off values for standardized devices.Authors of studies published before January 2015, reporting associations between platelet reactivity, ST, and major bleeding were contacted for a collaborative analysis using consensus-defined, uniform cut-offs for standardized platelet function assays. Based on best available evidence for each device (exploratory studies), LPR--OPR--HPR categories were defined as \&lt;95, 95--208, and \&gt;208 PRU for VerifyNow, \&lt;19, 19--46, and \&gt;46 U for the Multiplate analyser and \&lt;16, 16--50, and \&gt;50\% for VASP assay. Seventeen studies including 20 839 patients were used for the analysis; 97\% were treated with clopidogrel and 3\% with prasugrel. Patients with HPR had significantly higher risk for ST [risk ratio (RR) and 95\% CI: 2.73 (2.03--3.69), P \&lt; 0.00001], yet a slight reduction in bleeding [RR: 0.84 (0.71--0.99), P = 0.04] compared with those with OPR. In contrast, patients with LPR had a higher risk for bleeding [RR: 1.74 (1.47--2.06), P \&lt; 0.00001], without any further benefit in ST [RR: 1.06 (0.68--1.65), P = 0.78] in contrast to OPR. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with HPR compared with other categories (P \&lt; 0.05). Validation cohorts (n = 14) confirmed all results of exploratory studies (n = 3).Platelet reactivity assessment during thienopyridine-type P2Y12-inhibitors identifies PCI-treated patients at higher risk for mortality and ST (HPR) or at an elevated risk for bleeding (LPR).}

Although the success of TAVI is determined by multiple factors, good screening and appropriate patient selection is crucial. Selection of the right patient includes the determination of risk levels and feasibility of a safe procedure in each individual case. Here, we describe below our critical appraisal of patient selection for TAVI.},

  abstract = {Since optical coherence tomography (OCT) was first performed in humans two decades ago, this imaging modality has been widely adopted in research on coronary atherosclerosis and adopted clinically for the optimization of percutaneous coronary intervention. In the past 10 years, substantial advances have been made in the understanding of in vivo vascular biology using OCT. Identification by OCT of culprit plaque pathology could potentially lead to a major shift in the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Detection by OCT of healed coronary plaque has been important in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in plaque destabilization and healing with the rapid progression of atherosclerosis. Accurate detection by OCT of sequelae from percutaneous coronary interventions that might be missed by angiography could improve clinical outcomes. In addition, OCT has become an essential diagnostic modality for myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries. Insight into neoatherosclerosis from OCT could improve our understanding of the mechanisms of very late stent thrombosis. The appropriate use of OCT depends on accurate interpretation and understanding of the clinical significance of OCT findings. In this Review, we summarize the state of the art in cardiac OCT and facilitate the uniform use of this modality in coronary atherosclerosis. Contributions have been made by clinicians and investigators worldwide with extensive experience in OCT, with the aim that this document will serve as a standard reference for future research and clinical application.},

BACKGROUND: The applicability of QFR in patients with 3-vessel disease and the feasibility of fSS(QFR) have not yet been investigated. METHODS: All lesions interrogated using instantaneous wave-free ratio and/or fractional flow reserve in the SYNTAX II trial were retrospectively screened and analyzed for QFR. The diagnostic performance of QFR was investigated using hybrid wire-derived pressure assessment (instantaneous wave-free ratio and fractional flow reserve), used in the trial as a reference. Patients with analyzable QFR in 3 vessels were stratified according to fSS(QFR) to evaluate its clinical prognostic value on the basis of 2-year patient-oriented composite endpoint. RESULTS: QFRs were analyzable in 71.0\% of lesions (836 lesions). The diagnostic performance of QFR to predict binary wire-based ischemia was substantial (area under the curve 0.81, accuracy 73.8\%), with a positive predictive value of 85.9\%. Independent predictors of diagnostic discordance were lesions in side branches, involvement of bifurcation or trifurcation, and small vessel. According to the 2-year patient-oriented composite endpoint, fSS(QFR) reclassified 26.1\% of the patients (36 of 138) in the high- to intermediate-risk group into the low-risk group appropriately (net reclassification improvement 0.32; p~{$<$} 0.001). The area under the curve for fSS(QFR) to predict the 2-year patient-oriented composite endpoint was higher than that of the classic anatomic SYNTAX score (0.68 vs. 0.56; p~= 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: QFR demonstrated substantial applicability in patients with 3-vessel disease. The fSS(QFR) has the potential to further refine prognostic risk estimation compared with the classic anatomic SYNTAX score.},

It usually presents with markedly elevated calcium level and is severely symptomatic. It is associated with hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemias and solid cancers, particularly renal and breast carcinomas as well as squamous cell carcinomas of any organ. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the development of hypercalcemia of malignancy amongst them the osteolytic related hypercalcemia, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) mediated hypercalcemia, extrarenal 1,25 dixydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) mediated hypercalcemia and parathyroid hormone (PTH) related hypercalcemia either ectopic in origin or in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. Clinical history and and physical examination could point towards the correct diagnosis confirmed by the above-mentioned biochemical mediators of hypercalcemia. Early diagnosis and treatment lowering calcium levels in the blood can improve symptoms and the quality of life of these patients and avoid delays for further antitumor therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common and expensive condition, and studies of CLD-related hospitalizations have underestimated the true burden of disease. We analyzed data from a large, diverse health care system to compare time trends in CLD-related hospitalizations with those in congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We collected data from a large health care system in Texas on hospitalizations related to CLD (n~= 27,783), CHF (n~= 60,415), and COPD (n~= 34,199) from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2013. We calculated annual hospitalization rates (per 100,000) and compared hospital course, inpatient mortality, ancillary services, and readmissions. RESULTS: Compared with patients with CHF (median age, 71 years) or COPD (median age, 69 years), patients with CLD were significantly younger (median age, 57 years) (P {$<$} .01 vs CHF and COPD). Higher proportions of patients with CLD were uninsured (11.7\% vs 5.4\% for CHF and 5.4\% for COPD, P {$<$} .01) and Hispanic (17\% for CLD vs 9.3\% for CHF and 5.0\% for COPD, P~{$<$} .01). A lower proportion of patients with CLD had Medicare (41.5\% vs 68.6\% with CHF and 70.1\% with COPD, P {$<$} .01). From 2004 through 2013, the rate of CLD-related hospitalization increased by 92\% (from 1295/100,000 to 2490/100,000), compared with 6.7\% for CHF (from 3843/100,000 to 4103/100,000) and 48.8\% for COPD (from 1775/100,000 to 2642/100,000). During this time period, CLD-related hospitalizations covered by Medicare increased from 31.8\% to 41.5\%, whereas hospitalizations covered by Medicare did not change for CHF (remained at 70\%) or COPD (remained at 70\%). Patients with CLD had longer hospital stays (7.3 days vs 6.2 days for CHF and 5.9 days for COPD, P {$<$} .01). A higher proportion of patients with CLD died or were discharged to hospice (14.2\% vs 11.5\% of patients with CHF and 9.3\% of patients with COPD, P {$<$} .01), and a smaller proportion had access to postacute care (13.2\% vs 23.2\% of patients with CHF and 27.4\% of patients with COPD, P {$<$} .01). A higher proportion of patients with CLD were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days (25\% vs 21.9\% of patients with CHF and 20.6\% with COPD, P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLD, compared with selected other chronic diseases, had increasing rates of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, more readmissions, and, despite these adverse outcomes, less access to postacute care. Disease management models for CLD are greatly needed to manage the anticipated increase in hospitalizations for CLD.},

Murray law-based  quantitative-flow-ratio ({$\mu$}QFR) is a novel noninvasive method for the computation  of FFR. In the present study, we evaluated the clinical impact of {$\mu$}QFR, FFR, or  OCT guidance in FORZA trial lesions at 3-year follow-up. METHODS: {$\mu$}QFR was  assessed at baseline and, in the case of a decision to intervene, after (FFR- or  OCT-guided) PCI. The baseline {$\mu$}QFR was considered the final {$\mu$}QFR for deferred  lesions, and post-PCI {$\mu$}QFR value was taken as final for stented lesions. The  primary end point was target vessel failure ([TVF]; cardiac death,  target-vessel-related myocardial infarction, and target-vessel-revascularization)  at a 3-year follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 419 vessels (199 OCT-guided and 220  FFR-guided) were included in the FORZA trial. {$\mu$}QFR was evaluated in 256 deferred  lesions and 159 treated lesions (98 OCT-guided PCI and 61 FFR-guided PCI). In  treated lesions, post-PCI {$\mu$}QFR was higher in OCT-group compared with FFR-group  (median, 0.93 versus 0.91; P=0.023), and the post-PCI {$\mu$}QFR improvement was  greater in FFR-group (0.14 versus 0.08; P{$<$}0.0001). At 3-year follow-up, OCT- and  FFR-guided treatment decisions resulted in comparable TVF rate (6.7\% versus 7.9\%;  P=0.617). Final {$\mu$}QFR was the only predictor of TVF. {$\mu$}QFR {$\leq$}0.89 was associated  with 3{\texttimes} increase in TVF (11.6\% versus 3.7\%; P=0.004). PCI was a predictor of  higher final {$\mu$}QFR (odds ratio, 0.22 [95\% CI, 0.14-0.34]; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS:  In vessels with angiographically intermediate coronary lesions, OCT-guided PCI  resulted in comparable clinical outcomes as FFR-guided PCI. {$\mu$}QFR estimated at the  end of diagnostic or interventional procedure predicted 3-year TVF.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is described as pleural effusion secondary to liver cirrhosis after ruling out other etiologies. We aim to assess the efficacy of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement in refractory HH in this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive search of literature was performed from inception to December 2020. The authors reviewed, selected, and abstracted the data from eligible studies into Covidence, a systematic review software. Cochrane criteria was used to rate each study for the risk of bias. The data abstracted were described using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 test. RESULTS: Ten studies involving a total of 269 patients were included. The studies were analyzed for the proportion of pleurodesis achieved, the average time to pleurodesis, total complication rate, pleural infection rate, and mortality. A proportion of 47\% of the total subjects included achieved spontaneous pleurodesis in an average duration of 104.3 days. The frequency of total complication rate was noted to be 30.36\%. The incidence of pleural cavity infection was described to be 12.4\% and death resulting from complications of IPC was 3.35\%. CONCLUSION: The current management options for the refractory pleural effusion in HH include repeated thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, surgical repair of defects in the diaphragm, and liver transplantation. However, the cost, eligibility, and availability can be some of the major concerns with these treatment modalities. With this meta-analysis, we conclude that IPCs can provide an alternative therapeutic option for spontaneous pleurodesis.},

Complete clinical data, including outcomes, were abstracted from hospital records of patients with cirrhosis and ascites admitted to University of Texas Southwestern University teaching hospitals from January 2001 to July 2012. Hepatic hydrothorax was diagnosed based on currently accepted clinical characteristics of the disease, including a known diagnosis of cirrhosis, the presence of portal hypertension, pleural fluid analysis, and the absence of primary cardiopulmonary disease.Seventy-seven of 495 (16\%) hospitalized cirrhotic patients with pleural effusion (28 female; mean age, 52 yr) met the criteria for diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax. Resting dyspnea and cough were the most prominent presenting symptoms, occurring in 34\% and 22\% of patients, respectively. Pleural effusions were most often right-sided (56/77; 73\%), followed by left-sided only (13/77; 17\%) and bilateral effusions (8/77; 10\%); 7 (9\%) patients did not have detectable ascites. The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score at presentation was 16. The serum to pleural fluid albumin gradient (SPAG) was {$\geq$}1.1 in all 48 patients in whom it was measured. Most patients (64/77; 83\%) were managed with diuretics and/or thoracentesis, while 8 (10\%) underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and 5 (7\%) underwent liver transplant. A total of 44 of 77 (57\%) patients died during a mean follow-up of 12 months. The average time from presentation to death for all patients was 368 days, while for those after TIPS it was 845 days. No deaths were reported in the liver transplant group. The data indicate that a substantial number of patients with hepatic hydrothorax had what may be considered atypical presentations, including left-sided only effusions, or pleural effusion without ascites. Here, we propose that the term "serum to pleural fluid albumin gradient (SPAG)" be used to describe the gradient between serum and pleural fluid albumin levels and suggest that not only is it consistent with the portal hypertensive pathophysiology of hepatic hydrothorax, but also it is a useful criterion for diagnosis of hepatic hydrothorax. Finally, the overall outcome of hepatic hydrothorax was extremely poor, except in those undergoing TIPS or liver transplantation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of intravenous streptokinase, one month of oral aspirin, or both, on long term survival after suspected acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Randomised, "2 x 2 factorial," placebo controlled trial. SETTING: 417 hospitals in 16 countries. SUBJECTS: 17 187 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised between March 1985 and December 1987. Follow up of vital status complete to at least 1 January 1990 for 95\% of all patients and to mid-1997 for the 6213 patients in United Kingdom. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous streptokinase (1.5 MU in 1 hour) and oral aspirin (162 mg daily for 1 month) versus matching placebos. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from all causes during up to 10 years' follow up, with subgroup analyses based on 4 year follow up. RESULTS: After randomisation, 1841 deaths were recorded in days 0-35, 991 from day 36 to end of year 1, 1478 in years 2-4, and 1230 in years 5-10. Allocation to streptokinase was associated with 29 (95\% confidence interval 20 to 38) fewer deaths per 1000 patients during days 0-35. This early benefit persisted (death rate ratio 0.98 (0.92 to 1.04) for additional deaths between day 36 and end of year 10), so that there were 28 (14 to 42) and 23 (2 to 44) fewer deaths per 1000 patients treated with streptokinase after 4 years and 10 years respectively. There was no evidence that absolute survival benefit increased with prolonged follow up among any category of patient, including those presenting early after symptoms started or with anterior ST elevation. Nor did the early benefits seem to be lost in any category (including those aged over 70). Allocation to one month of aspirin was associated with 26 (16 to 35) fewer deaths per 1000 during first 35 days, with little further benefit or loss during subsequent years (death rate ratio 0.99 (0.93 to 1.06) between day 36 and end of year 10). The early benefit obtained with combination of streptokinase and one month of aspirin also seemed to persist long term. CONCLUSIONS: The early survival advantages produced by fibrinolytic therapy and one month of aspirin started in acute myocardial infarction seem to be maintained for at least 10 years.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Data suggest patients suffering acute coronary occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) benefit from prompt primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI).  Many emergency medical services (EMS) activate catheterization labs to reduce  time to PPCI, but suffer a high burden of inappropriate activations. Artificial  intelligence (AI) algorithms show promise to improve electrocardiogram (ECG)  interpretation. The primary objective was to evaluate the potential of AI to  reduce false positive activations without missing OMI. METHODS:  Electrocardiograms were categorized by (1) STEMI criteria, (2) ECG integrated  device software and (3) a proprietary AI algorithm (Queen of Hearts (QOH),  Powerful Medical). If multiple ECGs were obtained and any one tracing was  positive for a given method, that diagnostic method was considered positive. The  primary outcome was OMI defined as an angiographic culprit lesion with either  TIMI 0-2 flow; or TIMI 3 flow with either peak high sensitivity  troponin-I\,{$>$}\,5000\,ng/L or new wall motion abnormality. The primary analysis was  per-patient proportion of false positives. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were  screened and 117 met criteria. Of these, 48 met the primary outcome criteria of  OMI. There were 80 positives by STEMI criteria, 88 by device algorithm, and 77 by  AI software. All approaches reduced false positives, 27\% for STEMI, 22\% for  device software, and 34\% for AI (p\,{$<$}\,0.01 for all). The reduction in false  positives did not significantly differ between STEMI criteria and AI software  (p\,=\,0.19) but STEMI criteria missed 6 (5\%) OMIs, while AI missed none  (p\,=\,0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center retrospective study, an AI-driven  algorithm reduced false positive diagnoses of OMI compared to EMS clinician  gestalt. Compared to AI (which missed no OMI), STEMI criteria also reduced false  positives but missed 6 true OMI. External validation of these findings in  prospective cohorts is indicated.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinical documentation is a critical aspect of health care that enables healthcare providers to communicate effectively with each other and maintain accurate patient care records. Artificial intelligence tools, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, have the potential to assist healthcare providers in clinical documentation. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence conversational model that generates human-like responses to text-based prompts. In this study, we sought to investigate ChatGPT's ability to assist with writing a history of present illness based on standardized patient histories. METHODS: A blinded, randomized controlled study was conducted to compare the use of typing, dictation, and ChatGPT as tools to document history of present illness (HPI) of standardized patient histories. Eleven study participants, consisting of medical students, orthopaedic surgery residents, and attending surgeons, completed three HPIs using a different documentation technique for each one. Participants were randomized into cohorts based on the type of documentation technique. Participants were asked to interview standardized patients and document the patient's history of present illness using their assigned method. RESULTS: ChatGPT was found to be intermediate for speed; dictation was fastest, but produced markedly longer and higher quality patient histories based on Physician Documentation Quality Instrument score compared with dictation and typing. However, ChatGPT included erroneous information in 36\% of the documents. Poor agreement existed on the quality of patient histories between reviewers. DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that ChatGPT has the potential to improve clinical documentation by producing more comprehensive and organized HPIs. ChatGPT can generate longer and more detailed documentation compared with typing or dictation documentation methods. However, additional studies are needed to investigate and address concerns regarding privacy, bias, and accuracy of information.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients receiving DES  measuring {$\geq$}30 mm with FFR value {$\leq$}0.8 were included in the study. Stent length was  defined as long (30 to 49 mm; L-DES) and ultra-long ({$\geq$}50 mm; UL-DES).  Angiographic and FFR evaluation was performed before and after PCI and at  nine-month follow-up. A total of 74 patients each received a mean stent length of  50.72{\textpm}14.6 mm. Mean FFR post PCI was 0.88{\textpm}0.06. An optimal post PCI FFR value of  {$>$}0.95 was achieved in only 9/74 patients (12.2\%), and was not achieved in any  UL-DES patients. Only 12/74 (16.2\%) had FFR post PCI of 0.91 to 0.95; 8/74  (10.8\%) patients remained ischaemic ({$\leq$}0.8). FFR gradient across the stent was  higher in UL-DES patients compared to L-DES patients (0.07{\textpm}0.03 vs. 0.04{\textpm}0.03;  p=0.001). At follow-up, the angiographic restenosis rate was 4.7\%, and the  functional restenosis rate was 15.1\%. CONCLUSIONS: The FFR result post PCI was  suboptimal in the majority of patients treated with long DES and was particularly  poor when the total stent length exceeded 50 mm.},

Most of these individuals end up being hospitalized due to  uncertainty of the cause of their complaint. This aggressive and defensive  attitude is taken by emergency physicians because some 10 to 30\% of these  patients actually have acute coronary syndrome. As the admission  electrocardiogram and serum CK-MB level have a sensitivity of about 50\% for the  diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, serial evaluation is mandatory for  non-low risk patients. Inspite of this knowledge, an average of 2-3\% of patients  with acute myocardial infarction are erroneously released from emergency  departments, what is responsible for expensive malpractice suits in the United  States. Chest Pain Units were introduced in emergency practice two decades ago to  improve medical care quality, reduce inappropriate hospital discharges, reduce  unnecessary hospital admissions and reduce medical costs, thus making patient's  assessment cost-effective. This is achieved mostly with the use of systematic  diagnostic protocols by qualified and trained personnel in the emergency  department setting and not in the coronary care unit.},

Selatogrel is a novel, potent, reversible, and selective 2-phenylprimdine-4-carboxamide administered subcutaneously under development. Results from preclinical, phase 1, and phase 2 trials have confirmed that the agent provides sustained and reversible P2Y12 platelet inhibition with an acceptable safety profile. The most commonly reported adverse effects include minor bleeding and dyspnea. Phase 3 trials are being designed to understand the critical role this agent can play in upstream management of patients with ACS including a more defined understanding of the adverse effect profile, how to transition from this agent to an oral agent, who will be administering, and does this agent allow for a safe and quick transition to coronary artery bypass graft surgery if needed. Should it obtain approval, selatogrel has the potential to provide a unique and advantageous mechanism for P2Y12 inhibition.},

Unlike traditional approaches, {$\mu$}QFR does not require pressure wires or  hyperemia induction. However, its accuracy compared to Fractional Flow Reserve  (FFR) for calcified lesions (ACC/AHA classification B2 or C) remains  underexplored. AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of {$\mu$}QFR  in detecting hemodynamically significant calcified coronary stenosis, defined as  FFR\,{$\leq$}\,0.80. METHODS: In this two-center, investigator-initiated trial, patients  with calcified lesions (B2 or C, 30\%-90\% diameter stenosis) and FFR assessment  during coronary angiography were included. {$\mu$}QFR was calculated by a nurse blinded  to the FFR results. Sensitivity and specificity of {$\mu$}QFR were compared with FFR as  the gold standard. RESULTS: Among 125 patients, paired {$\mu$}QFR and FFR data were  available for 107 patients and 120 lesions. Mean FFR, {$\mu$}QFR, and percent stenosis  were 0.775 (95\% CI: 0.757-0.793), 0.788 (95\% CI: 0.772-0.805), and 56.75\%  (\,{\textpm}\,10.14\%), respectively. {$\mu$}QFR demonstrated a sensitivity of 75\% (95\% CI:  65.6\%-84.6\%), a specificity of 77.8\% (95\% CI: 63.5\%-92.0\%), a diagnostic  precision of 75.8\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  of 0.813 (95\% CI: 0.714-0.911). The positive predictive value was 88.7\%, and the  negative predictive value was 57.1\%. The positive and negative likelihood ratios  were 3.38 and 0.32, respectively. CONCLUSION: {$\mu$}QFR is simple to compute and  offers moderate diagnostic accuracy for calcified coronary stenosis. It provides  a valuable alternative when FFR is unavailable or technically challenging.},

  abstract = {This review illustrates current approaches to the study of the disposition in man of the strong analagesics morphine and methadone and the narcotic antagonist naloxone. Morphine administered orally is rapidly absorbed but equally rapidly metabolised to morphine glucuronide. This contributes to the diminished oral efficacy of morphine. Following intramuscular administration morphine is very rapidly absorbed. After intravenous injection, the serum levels of morphine during the first 10 minutes are higher and more variable in older patients. The half-life of morphine between 20 minutes and 6 hours is 2 to 3 hours and this value does not appear to be influenced by the age of the patient. Similar half-lives for morphine have been reported to normal volunteers and in anaethetised patients who received morphine. Thus, surgical anaesthesia may not markedly influence morphine half-life and disposition. Based on urinary excretion data in man, accelerated morphine metabolism and excretion do not contribute to morphine tolerance. Methadone is now widely used in the treatment of narcotic abuse. The half-life of methadone averages 25 hours. The prolonged retention of methadone in the plasma may be related to its extensive binding to plasma proteins. With chronic dosing, studies in both animals and man indicate an increase in the metabolism of methadone. Unlike morphine, the urinary excretion of methadone increases with acidification of the urine. Women may metabolise methadone to a greater extent than do men. With the exception of pupillary effects, the plasma levels of methadone correlate poorly with its pharmacological activity. There is a marked variation in methadone plasma levels between patients and within the same patient. Naloxone rapidly disappears from the serum in man and the initial distribution phase has a half-life of 4 minutes. The half-life of naloxone in serum following distribution is 64 minutes. Based on animal studies, the rapid onset of the narcotic antagonist action of naloxone can be related to its rapid entry into the brain, whereas its potency stems in part from its high lipid solubility which allows a high brain concentration to be achieved. The short duration of action of naloxone may result from its rapid egress from the brain.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) quantitative flow ratio (QFR)  measurements to predict clinical outcomes in patients with successful PCI.  BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of QFR measured immediately after PCI has not  been prospectively investigated. METHODS: Patients undergoing complete  revascularization with successful PCI and stent implantation were eligible for  acquisition of projections for QFR computation. At the end of the procedure, 2  angiographic projections for each vessel treated with PCI were acquired.  Computation of QFR was performed offline by an independent core laboratory. The  primary outcome was the vessel-oriented composite endpoint, defined as  vessel-related cardiovascular death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, and  ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-one  vessels in 602 patients were analyzed. The median value of post-PCI QFR was 0.97  (interquartile range: 0.92 to 0.99). Lesion location in the left anterior  descending coronary artery, baseline SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and  Cardiac Surgery) score, lesion length, and post-PCI diameter stenosis were found  to be predictors of lower post-PCI QFR. Altogether, 77 events were detected in 53  treated vessels (7\%). Post-PCI QFR was significantly lower in vessels with the  vessel-oriented composite endpoint during follow-up, compared with those without  it (0.88 [interquartile range: 0.81 to 0.99] vs. 0.97 [interquartile range: 0.93  to 0.99], respectively; p~{$<~$}0.001). Receiver-operating characteristic curve  analysis identified a post-PCI QFR best cutoff of~{$\leq$}0.89 (area under the curve  0.77; 95\% confidence interval: 0.74 to 0.80; p~{$<~$}0.001). After correction for  potential confounding factors, post-PCI QFR~{$\leq$}0.89 was associated with a 3-fold  increase in risk for the vessel-oriented composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 2.91;  95\% confidence interval: 1.63 to 5.19; p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lower values of  QFR after complete and successful revascularization predict subsequent adverse  events (Angio-Based Fractional Flow Reserve to Predict Adverse Events After Stent  Implantation [HAWKEYE]; NCT02811796).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the presence of inferior myocardial infarction (MI), ST depression (STD) in lead I has been claimed to be accurate for diagnosis of right  ventricular (RV) MI. We sought to evaluate this claim and also whether ST  Elevation (STE) in lead V1 would be helpful, with or without STD in V2. METHODS:  Retrospective study of consecutive inferior STEMI, comparing ECGs of patients  with, to those without, RVMI, as determined by angiographic coronary occlusion  proximal to the RV marginal branch. STE and STD were measured at the J-point,  relative to the PQ junction. The primary outcomes were sensitivity/specificity of  1) STD in lead I\,{$\geq$}\,0.5\,mm and 2) STE in lead V1\,{$\geq$}\,0.5\,mm, stratified by presence  or absence of posterior (inferobasal) MI, as determined by {$\geq$}0.5\,mm STD in lead  V2, for differentiating RVMI from non-RVMI. RESULTS: Of 149 patients with  inferior STEMI, 43 (29\%) had RVMI and 106 (71\%) did not. There was no difference  in the presence or absence of at least 0.5\,mm STD in Lead I between patients with  (37/43, 86\%) vs. without RVMI (85/106, 80\%, p\,=\,0.56). In those with, vs.  without, RVMI, (15/43, 35\%) had STE in V1, versus (17/106, 16\%) (p\,=\,0.015).  Specificity of STE in V1 for RVMI was 84\%; sensitivity was 35\%. Sensitivity was  higher without (69\%), than with (35\%), STD in V2. CONCLUSION: Among inferior  STEMI, the presence of any ST depression in lead I does not help to diagnose  RVMI. ST elevation {$\geq$}0.5\,mm in lead V1 is specific for RVMI, and moderately  sensitive only if concomitant STD\,{$\geq$}\,0.5\,mm in V2 is not present. Although STE in  V1 is quite specific, overall the diagnostic characteristics of the standard  12-lead ECG are inadequate to definitively diagnose, or exclude, RVMI, as defined  angiographically.},

  abstract = {The addition of clopidogrel to aspirin treatment reduces ischemic events in a wide range of patients with cardiovascular disease. However, recurrent ischemic event occurrence during dual antiplatelet therapy, including stent thrombosis, remains a major concern. Platelet function measurements during clopidogrel treatment demonstrated a variable and overall modest level of P2Y12inhibition. High on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was observed in selected patients. Multiple studies have now demonstrated a clear association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP measured by multiple methods and adverse clinical event occurrence. However, the routine measurement of platelet reactivity has not been widely implemented and recommended in the guidelines. Reasons for the latter include: 1) a lack of consensus on the optimal method to quantify high on-treatment platelet reactivity and the cutoff value associated with clinical risk; and 2) limited data to support that alteration of therapy based on platelet function measurements actually improves outcomes. This review provides a consensus opinion on the definition of high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP based on various methods reported in the literature and proposes how this measurement may be used in the future care of patients.},

BACKGROUND: The use of coronary  stents has contributed to the reduction of cardiovascular mortality but can be  associated with specific complications. Improving the biomechanical matching  between the stents and the coronary anatomy may reduce these complications.  METHODS: We assessed five commercially available drug-eluting stents: the Absorb,  Orsiro, Resolute Onyx, Synergy, and Xience Alpine stents. Following stent  deployment at nominal pressure in ambient air, radial elastic recoil and  foreshortening were measured. Flexibility (crimped and deployed stents) and  longitudinal and radial resistances were evaluated using a mechanical tester.  RESULTS: Biomechanical characteristics were significantly different for all  tested devices (ANOVA, P\,{$<$}\,0.01). The Synergy, Orsiro, and Xience Alpine stents  presented the lowest elastic recoil. The Synergy and Resolute Onyx stents were  the most flexible devices. The Xience Alpine and Absorb stents had the highest  longitudinal and radial resistances. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-eluting coronary stents  used in current clinical practice have very different biomechanical  characteristics, which should be taken into consideration to select the most  appropriate device for each clinical situation.},

This narrative review shows that heart and mental health are not isolated domains  but deeply interconnected, influencing each other. It describes how  cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) can cause mental health issues such as stress,  anxiety, and depression. It also explains how these mental conditions can, in  turn, worsen or raise the risk of CVDs. In addition, it emphasizes the necessity  of a holistic approach to healthcare that integrates the treatment of physical  symptoms of CVDs with interventions aimed at addressing mental health issues.  This approach advocates for comprehensive care strategies that include  psychotherapy, pharmacological treatments, lifestyle modifications, and digital  health technologies. It also highlights the significant role of family and social  support in recovery and discusses barriers to integrating mental health care in  cardiovascular treatment. The article argues for a paradigm shift in healthcare  towards more inclusive and integrated care models. The authors hope to foster a  healthcare environment that prioritizes holistic care by increasing awareness  about the connection between heart and mind. The call to action includes policy  changes and healthcare system reforms aimed at facilitating the integration of  mental health services into cardiovascular care, ultimately leading to improved  outcomes for patients with CVDs and associated mental health issues.},

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate to what extent and at which  time patients drop out of CR, and to assess which patient-related characteristics  can predict dropout. METHODS: In a~retrospective cohort study, we selected  patients who had been hospitalised with an AMI in our centre in 2015 or 2016.  Patients were selected pseudonymously based on reimbursement codes in the  electronic health record. We extracted baseline characteristics and data on CR  referral, enrolment and completion for each patient. Multivariable logistic  regression was used to assess which characteristics predicted referral and  dropout. RESULTS: The 666~patients included were predominantly male (66\%), with  a~mean age of 69.0~years. Of the 640 eligible patients, 201 (31\%) were not  referred for CR. Enrolment after referral was 94\%. Nonreferral was independently  associated with older age, female sex, traveling distance, non-ST-elevation  myocardial infarction (NSTEMI; as compared with STEMI), no coronary  revascularisation and prior manifestations of coronary artery disease. Of the 414  enrolled patients, 24\% did not complete their CR programmes (i.e. dropped out).  Older age and worse exercise capacity at baseline were independently associated  with dropout. The ability of the multiple regression models to predict  nonreferral and noncompletion was good to fair, with an area under the receiver  operating characteristic curves of 0.86 and 0.71, respectively. CONCLUSION: The  main reason for not participating in or not completing CR after AMI was  nonreferral. To optimise CR utilisation, improvement of referral rates should be  prioritised.},

BACKGROUND: Substantial numbers of eligible patients are not  referred to cardiac rehabilitation at hospital discharge despite proven  reductions in mortality and national guideline recommendations. METHODS: We used  data from the American Heart Association's Get With The Guidelines program,  analyzing 72,817 patients discharged alive after a myocardial infarction,  percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery  between January 2000 and September 2007 from 156 hospitals. We identified factors  associated with cardiac rehabilitation referral at discharge and performed  multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for clustering, to identify which  factors were independently associated with cardiac rehabilitation referral.  RESULTS: Mean age was 64.1 +/- 13.0 years, 68\% were men, 79\% were white, and 30\%  had diabetes, 66\% hypertension, and 52\% dyslipidemia; mean body mass index was  29.1 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2), and mean ejection fraction 49.0 +/- 13.6\%. All patients  were admitted for coronary artery disease (CAD), with 71\% admitted for myocardial  infarction. Overall, only 40,974 (56\%) were referred to cardiac rehabilitation at  discharge, ranging from 53\% for myocardial infarction to 58\% for percutaneous  coronary intervention and to 74\% for coronary artery bypass graft patients. Older  age, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and the presence of most  comorbidities were associated with decreased odds of cardiac rehabilitation  referral. CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong evidence for benefit, only 56\% of eligible  CAD patients discharged from these hospitals were referred to cardiac  rehabilitation. Increased physician awareness about the benefits of cardiac  rehabilitation and initiatives to overcome barriers to referral are critical to  improve the quality of care of patients with CAD.},

METHODS: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies with multivariable adjustement were included. MACE (Major Adverse Cardiac Events) was the primary end point, while its single components (death, myocardial infarction, and total vessel revascularization [TVR]) along with number of anastomoses, on pump procedures and graft occlusion at angiographic follow-up were the secondary ones. Each analysis was stratified for RCTs versus observational studies. RESULTS: Four studies (two RCTs and two observational) were included, enrolling 983 patients, 542 angio-guided and 441 FFR-guided. Mean age was 68.45\,years, 79\% male, with a mean EuroSCORE I of 2.7. Coronary lesions were located in 37\% of patients in the left anterior descending artery, 32\% in the circumflex artery, and 26\% in the right coronary artery. After a mean follow-up of 40\,months, risk of MACE did not differ (OR 0.86 [0.63-1.18]) as that of all cause death (OR 0.86 [0.59-1.25]), MI (OR 0.57 [0.30-1.11]) and TVR (OR 1.10 [0.65-1.85]). FFR-driven CABG reduced on-pump procedures (OR 0.58 [0.35-0.93]) and number of anastomoses (-0.40 [-0.80: -0.01]) while incidence of graft occlusion at follow-up did not differ (OR 0.59 [0.30-1.15], all CI 95\%). CONCLUSION: Fraction flow reserve driven CABG reduced the number of anastomoses and of on-pump procedures without increasing risk of MACE and without reducing graft occlusion at angiographic follow-up.

The balloon technology relies on the concept of targeted drug delivery, which helps in the rapid healing of the vessel wall and prevents the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Several drug eluting devices in the form of coated balloons are currently in clinical use, namely DIOR{\textregistered}, PACCOCATH{\textregistered}, SeQuent{\textregistered}Please and IN.PACT™. The device varies in terms of the material used for making the balloon, the coating techniques, the choice of coated drug and the release pattern of the drug at the site. This review gives an insight into the evolution, rationale and comparison of the marketed drug-eluting balloons. Here, different coating techniques have been analysed for the application and critical analysis of available DEB technologies, and a technical comparison has been done.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: De novo diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) is a challenging scenario in interventional cardiology with limited treatment option, beside stent  implantation. In this context, a hybrid approach, combining the use of  drug-eluting stent (DES) and drug-coated balloon (DCB) to treat different  segments of the same lesion (e.g. long lesion and/or true bifurcation), might be  an interesting and alternative strategy to limit the metal amount. The aim of  this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a hybrid approach in  addressing percutaneous treatment of de novo diffuse CAD. METHODS: This was a  prospective, multicenter study including patients affected by de novo diffuse CAD  treated with a hybrid approach from April 2019 to December 2020. Angiographic and  clinical data were collected. The primary endpoint was the one-year  device-oriented composite endpoint (DOCE, cardiac death, target vessel myocardial  infarction and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [ID-TLR]).  Periprocedural myocardial infarctions and periprocedural success were included  among secondary endpoints. RESULTS: One hundred six patients were included, mean  age was 68.2{\textpm}10.2 years and 78.3\% were male. De novo diffuse CAD consisted of  52.8\% long lesions and 47.2\% true bifurcation lesions. Significant increase in  the final minimal lumen diameters and significant decrease in the final diameter  stenosis were observed when compared to the baseline values in both DES- and  DCB-target segments. Procedural success was 96.2\%. DOCE at one-year was 3.7\%,  with all the adverse events characterized by ID-TLR. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of  DES and DCB could be a safe and effective treatment option for the treatment of  de novo diffuse CAD (NCT03939468).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal management of cardiogenic shock (CS) occurring in the presence of acute coronary syndromes, severe aortic stenosis, and poor left ventricular function has not been established. Recently, the availability of new assistance devices and techniques has provided novel management opportunities. In particular, when compared with surgical approaches, percutaneous procedures have the advantage of allowing "staged" interventions, in which different steps are planned according to the patient's evolving clinical conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: A woman was admitted with an acute coronary syndrome complicated by CS on a background of severe aortic stenosis, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and severe calcific peripheral artery disease. We successfully treated her with emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to left main stem followed by balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). After BAV, acute aortic regurgitation developed with sudden hemodynamic collapse. In such a catastrophic setting, we successfully achieved immediate stabilization by implantation of an Impella CP device (Abiomed). After 1 day of Impella CP assistance, we successfully performed elective transfemoral aortic revalving through the same femoral access by facilitating device crossing and hemostasis with transradial balloon peripheral angioplasty and by practicing a novel technique we called "pump rewiring." CONCLUSION: This case example demonstrates how a tailored step-by-step strategy including PCI, BAV, peripheral angioplasty, percutaneous ventricular assistance, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) allowed the successful treatment of a critical patient with CS. Impella CP could be considered an effective bridge to TAVI in patients developing aortic regurgitation after BAV, since maintaining arterial access can be achieved using the pump-rewiring technique.},

  abstract = {The evaluation for European Union market approval of coronary stents falls under the Medical Device Directive that was adopted in 1993. Specific requirements for  the assessment of coronary stents are laid out in supplementary advisory  documents. In response to a call by the European Commission to make  recommendations for a revision of the advisory document on the evaluation of  coronary stents (Appendix{\enspace}1 of MEDDEV 2.7.1), the European Society of Cardiology  (ESC) and the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions  (EAPCI) established a Task Force to develop an expert advisory report. As basis  for its report, the ESC-EAPCI Task Force reviewed existing processes, established  a comprehensive list of all coronary drug-eluting stents that have received a CE  mark to date, and undertook a systematic review of the literature of all  published randomized clinical trials evaluating clinical and angiographic  outcomes of coronary artery stents between 2002 and 2013. Based on these data,  the TF provided recommendations to inform a new regulatory process for coronary  stents. The main recommendations of the task force include implementation of a  standardized non-clinical assessment of stents and a novel clinical evaluation  pathway for market approval. The two-stage clinical evaluation plan includes  recommendation for an initial pre-market trial with objective performance  criteria (OPC) benchmarking using invasive imaging follow-up leading to  conditional CE-mark approval and a subsequent mandatory, large-scale randomized  trial with clinical endpoint evaluation leading to unconditional CE-mark. The  data analysis from the systematic review of the Task Force may provide a basis  for determination of OPC for use in future studies. This paper represents an  executive summary of the Task Force's report.},

BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of recurrent ISR after DCB  angioplasty. QFR is a novel method for fast computation of fractional flow  reserve for the target vessel based on quantitative coronary angiography (QCA)  and fluid dynamics algorithms. METHODS: Patients participating in the RESTORE ISR  China randomized trial were enrolled and classified into the recurrent restenosis  group and the non-recurrent restenosis group. The binary classifications followed  the QCA standards of ISR. Clinical and angiographic characteristics of the groups  were analyzed, and the QFRs before and after lesion preparation and after final  DCB angioplasty were measured and compared. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients who  underwent follow-up angiography were enrolled in the study, with 226 lesions  measured in total. QFR value after DCB angioplasty (odds ratio [OR] 0.88; 95\%  confidence interval [CI] 0.83-0.93; p\,{$<$}\,.0001 for 1\,mm increase), lesion length  (OR: 1.08; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.15; p = .017), and vessel caliber lumen diameter (OR:  0.35; 95\% CI 0.13-0.89; p = .027) were independently associated with recurrent  restenosis after DCB angioplasty. The optimal QFR cut-off value was determined to  be 0.90 with a sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.56, and accuracy of 0.79 in  predicting recurrent restenosis. CONCLUSIONS: The QFR value after DCB angioplasty  is a promising predictor of DES ISR.},

  abstract = {Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension often have abnormal extracellular fluid volume regulation, resulting in accumulation of fluid as ascites, oedema or pleural effusion. These complications carry a poor prognosis with nearly half of the patients with ascites dying in the ensuing 2-3 years. In contrast to what happens in the abdominal cavity where large amounts of fluid (5-8 L) accumulate with the patient only experiencing only mild symptoms, in the thoracic cavity smaller amounts of fluid (1-2 L) cause severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and hypoxaemia. Hepatic hydrothorax is defined as a pleural effusion, usually {$>$}500 mL, in patients with cirrhosis without cardiopulmonary disease. The pathophysiology involves the direct movement of ascitic fluid from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space through diaphragmatic defects. The estimated prevalence among cirrhotic patients is 5-10\%. The effusion, which is a transudate, most commonly occurs in the right hemithorax. The mainstay of therapy is similar to that of portal hypertensive ascites and includes sodium restriction and administration of diuretics. Refractory hydrothorax can be managed with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in selected cases. Pleurodesis is not routinely recommended. Suitable patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be considered candidates for liver transplantation.},

Identification of the variables associated with these delays could improve health care. Methods Analysis of the Codi Infart registry of Catalonia and of the time to angioplasty depending on the place of first medical contact. Results In 3832 patients analyzed, first medical contact took place in primary care centers in 18\% and in hospitals without a catheterization laboratory in 37\%. Delays were longer in these 2 groups than in patients attended by the outpatient emergency medical system or by hospitals with a catheterization laboratory (P {$<$} .0001, results in median): first medical contact to reperfusion indication time was 42minutes in both (overall 35minutes); first medical contact to artery opening time was 131 and 143minutes, respectively (overall 121minutes); total ischemia time was 230 and 260minutes (overall 215minutes). First medical contact to artery opening time {$>$} 120minutes was strongly associated with first medical contact in a center without a catheterization laboratory (OR, 4.96; 95\% confidence interval, 4.14-5.93), and other factors such as age, previous coronary surgery, first medical contact during evening hours, nondiagnostic electrocardiogram, and Killip class {$\geq$} III.

Defects of P2Y12R should be suspected when ADP, even at high concentrations ({$\geq$} 10 {$\mu$}m), is unable to induce full, irreversible platelet aggregation. P2Y12R also plays a role in inflammation: its role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma has been well characterized. In addition, inhibition or genetic deficiency of P2Y12R has antitumor effects. Drugs inhibiting P2Y12R are potent antithrombotic drugs. Clopidogrel is the P2Y12R antagonist that is most widely used in the clinical setting. Its most important drawback is its inability to inhibit adequately P2Y12R-dependent platelet function in about one-third of patients.

  abstract = {Pathologic cancer stage, crucial for treatment decisions, is often buried in unstructured pathology reports. This study investigates using pre-trained clinical LLMs for stage extraction, leveraging prompting techniques like chain-of-thought to enhance model transparency. While self-consistency methods further improve LLM performance, they can introduce inconsistencies in reasoning paths and predictions. We propose an ensemble reasoning approach, aiming for reliable cancer stage extraction. Utilizing an open-source clinical LLM on real-world reports, we demonstrate that the ensemble approach improves consistency and boosts performance, paving the way for utilizing LLMs in healthcare settings where reliability and interpretability are paramount.},

HYPOTHESIS: The clinical  outcomes of AIW-STEMI caused by RCA and LCX occlusion may be different for  patients undergoing primary PCI. METHODS: Between May 2002 and September 2009,  646 consecutive patients with AIW-STEMI undergoing primary PCI were enrolled. Of  these patients, 520 (80.5\%) with AIW-STEMI caused by RCA occlusion were  categorized into group 1, whereas the remaining 126 (19.5\%) whose AIW-STEMI was  caused by LCX occlusion served as group 2. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that  the frequency of advanced congestive heart failure, respiratory failure requiring  mechanical ventilatory support, and 30-day mortality were remarkably higher in  group 2 than in group 1 (all P {$<$} 0.01). Conversely, the incidence of right  ventricular infarction and complete heart block were notably higher in group 1  than in group 2 (all P {$<$} 0.001). Additionally, the peak level of creatine  kinase-isoenzyme MB was significantly higher, whereas the left ventricular  ejection fraction was notably lower in group 2 than in group 1. Multivariate  analysis demonstrated that advanced CHF, high serum creatinine level, low  systolic blood pressure, low left ventricular ejection fraction, and LCX as the  infarct-related artery were significantly and independently predictive of 30-day  mortality (all P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 30-day prognostic outcome was less  favorable in LCX-related AIW-STEMI compared with RCA-related AIW-STEMI undergoing  primary PCI.},

Murray law-based QFR ({$\mu$}QFR) is a new method for physiological assessment that has  higher feasibility and efficiency. The purpose of this study was to investigate  the performance of {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI in improving post-PCI outcomes.  METHODS: The QUITE RIGHT study (Quantitative Flow Ratio Virtual Stenting and  Angiography Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is a prospective,  multicenter, blinded, randomized, controlled superiority study. Eligible patients  were randomized 1:1 to either the {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI group or the  angiography-guided PCI group. The primary end point was the proportion of the  target vessels with a post-PCI {$\mu$}QFR {$\geq$}0.90, accepted as an optimal post-PCI  physiological outcome. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients with 666 vessels were  enrolled. The optimal physiological outcome was reached more often in the  {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI group (absolute difference, 9.1\% [95\% CI, 4.53-13.76];  P{$<$}0.001). The {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI group had a better QFR value, a lower  contrast agent dose and x-ray dose, and a more appropriate stent length than the  angiography-guided group. CONCLUSIONS: The QUITE RIGHT study showed that the  {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI strategy is superior to angiography-guided PCI in terms  of physiological outcomes. The {$\mu$}QFR-guided virtual PCI strategy is associated  with lower contrast and x-ray doses and a more appropriate stent length.

There is no doubt that despite the increasing number of assessment methods used clinically, the prognosis assessment is still not ideal, and newer assessment methods are needed.Objective: To investigate the predictive value of quantitative flow ratio (QFR) for adverse events (VOCE/TLF) in patients after PCI.Method: Eight studies involving 4,173 patients (5,688 vascular lesions) were included.These are studies of the relationship between QFR values and prognosis of adverse cardiac events after PCI. This meta-analysis was performed after quality assessment and data extraction of clinical trials data that met the inclusion criteria.Result: Each of the 8 studies described the cut-off values for the best predictive ability of post-PCI QFR and the hazard ratio (HR) between QFR values and adverse events, respectively. The pooled HR of these studies was 4.72(95\%CI:3.29,6.75).Concurrently, lower post-PCI QFR values were associated with the occurrence of individual clinical events (cardiac death/MI/TVR), with RRs of 6.51 (95\%CI:4.96, 8.53), 4.83(95\%CI:3.08,7.57), and 4.21(95\%CI:2.66,6.68), respectively. Conclusion: QFR may have great potential in the assessment of prognosis. It is necessary to measure QFR value after PCI. A lower QFR value after PCI was an important predictor for experiencing adverse events.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Drug-eluting stents (DES) are still the standard of care in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) since the fall of bioresorbable  scaffolds with respect to safety. The unbeatable advantage of a metallic stent  when compared with a scaffold is a stronger mechanical property and more  sustainable vascular support. Recent development of contemporary metallic stent  has focused on the reduction of strut thickness. However, there will always be a  trade-off between improvement in deliverability, flexibility, and radial  strength. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to discuss the designs of metallic  stent platform and mechanical properties as well as mechanical performance of  contemporary DES from bench studies and clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION:  Mechanical properties of stents affect short- and long-term clinical outcomes.  Ultrathin-strut DES have become popular and clinical trials have shown impressive  results. Thinner struts may improve device flexibility and deliverability but the  radial strength and longitudinal integrity might have been compromised as well.  Ultrathin-strut cobalt chromium or platinum chromium DES will become standard of  care in PCI practice in the near future. Information on the stent design, stent  material and mechanical properties of the stent are essential for a rational  selection of the appropriate stent in selected lesions and patients.},

Beyond their many advantages, stents also have their  limitations and complications. Allergic reactions to coronary stents are more  common than acknowledged. These stented patients are exposed to foreign  substances inserted in direct contact with the coronary intima. Hypersensitivity  to stent components and drugs prescribed after stent insertion together with any  environmental exposure seem to contribute to these adverse reactions. Patients  can present to the hospital with a wide range of symptoms and multiple  complications, the most important ones being instent restenosis and stent  thrombosis. Although not very common (and not always easy to identify), allergic  reactions after coronary or peripheral stents should be taken into account.  Careful selection of patients (for elective stent implantation) depending on the  propensity to allergies, although hard to achieve, represents a key factor in  reducing the number of these complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is a common complication of advanced cancer. PTH-independent HCM may be mediated through different mechanisms: (1) humoral HCM, caused by the secretion of PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), (2) local osteolysis resulting from metastatic lesions, and (3) calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia. Calcitriol-mediated HCM in patients with nonlymphomatous solid tumors is thought to be rare. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review from 2008 to 2017 to characterize further patients at our institution with solid tumors who had HCM with concomitant elevations in calcitriol. Patients with PTH-dependent hypercalcemia and patients with evidence of granulomatous disease were excluded, as were patients with hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that patients with HCM and elevated calcitriol levels would respond less favorably to treatment with antiresorptive therapy compared with patients with HCM but without calcitriol elevation. We also aimed to assess mortality and determine if PTHrP and phosphorus levels correlate with calcitriol because both factors may alter calcitriol levels. RESULTS: Of 101 eligible patients, calcitriol was elevated in 45 (45\%). PTHrP was elevated in 76\% of patients with elevated calcitriol compared with 52\% of patients without calcitriol elevation. The mean PTHrP value did not differ between patients with HCM and elevated calcitriol (36.3 {\textpm} 22 pg/mL) and those without calcitriol elevation (37.4 {\textpm} 19 pg/mL). Those with elevated calcitriol levels generally did not respond completely to antiresorptive treatment (80\% incomplete response rate), whereas most patients without an elevation in calcitriol responded well to antiresorptive treatment (78\% response rate: P {$<$} .001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with metastatic bone disease among the 2 groups (49\% vs. 55\%, respectively). There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .14). A weak but significant negative correlation was found between phosphorus and calcitriol (Pearson r = -0.261, P = .016). This correlation was only significant in patients without calcitriol elevation (Pearson r = -0.4, P = .0082). Also, a significant negative correlation was found between PTHrP and phosphorus, again only in patients without calcitriol elevation. DISCUSSION: In the setting of HCM, patients with calcitriol elevation are much less likely to respond to antiresorptive therapy than patients without calcitriol elevation. Because calcitriol elevation did not appear to be correlated with hypophosphatemia or elevated PTHrP, it would appear that calcitriol production under these conditions is autonomous, and not subject to normal physiological controls. These observations indicate that calcitriol elevations in patients with HCM have clinical significance.},

Baseline, post-balloon and 9-month  angiographical parameters were obtained from 116 lesions of 104 patients. The  cutoff value of iFR after balloon angioplasty used to define functionally  nonsignificant residual stenotic lesions was 0.86 and they were subdivided into  PCB or Stent group according to the treated device. The primary endpoint was late  lumen loss at 9~months and the secondary endpoint was target vessel failure (TVF)  at 3~years. Fifty-eight lesions were treated with PCB only and 58 lesions were  treated with metal stent~implantation. There were no differences in iFR between  PCB and Stent groups at baseline (0.76\,{\textpm}\,0.19 vs. 0.73\,{\textpm}\,0.23, p\,=\,0.630) and  after procedure (0.93\,{\textpm}\,0.04 vs. 0.94\,{\textpm}\,0.05, p\,=\,0.574).

Therefore, it is important to determine the  factors contributing to the clinical manifestation and outcome, such as the  culprit location. AIMS: To determine the relationship between the location of the  culprit plaque and clinical outcomes in the LCx artery. METHODS: Data from the  Polish Registry of Invasive Cardiology Procedures (ORPKI) from the years  2019-2020 concerning percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures were  extracted and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: 97 899  clinical records were analyzed. Patients with proximal occlusion received a worse  grade using the Killip classification. Patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial  Infarction (TIMI) score 0 had worse clinical presentation in each of the  occlusion locations. The periprocedural cardiac arrest and death rates were the  highest among patients with proximal circumflex (Cx) occlusion. The death rate  among patients with proximal occlusion and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial  infarction (NSTEMI) was greater than among patients with distal occlusion and  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients  with proximal occlusions of the Cx artery and TIMI 0 grade flow on initial  angiogram, a STEMI-like approach should be undertaken apart from initial ECG  findings. This is driven by a higher rate of critical and fatal complications  such as cardiac arrest and periprocedural death. Fatal complications occur more  often in patients with proximal occlusion of Cx than in medial or distal  occlusion. Grade IV according to the Killip classification can suggest a proximal  culprit location.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the size of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the time of initiation of  reperfusion therapy with cardiac perfusion scintigraphy. MATERIAL AND METHODS  Overall, 80 patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were  examined. All patients were treated with primary percutaneous coronary  intervention (pPCI). Data on patient and system delay expressed in minutes were  recorded and compared with recommended timelines. Cardiac scintigraphy was  performed with 99m Tc-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography  (SPECT). The median time of cardiac scintigraphy was 20 days. The correlation  between the size of infarction and the time of initiation of reperfusion therapy  was evaluated. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 60.5{\textpm}11.5 years, and 72.5\%  were male. The average system delay was 348 min, and the average patient delay  was 173 min. The mean total ischemic time was 800 min. There was a correlation  between time delays of reperfusion therapy and infarct size. Patients with a  shorter time delay to patent artery after FMC showed smaller infarct size when  compared to the patients with longer delay times. Multiple linear regression  analysis showed that FMC, being male, and smokers had statistical significance  when predicting infarct size. CONCLUSIONS There is a correlation between the size  of myocardial infarction and the time of initiation of reperfusion therapy  determined by perfusion myocardial scintigraphy. The study showed that there are  time delays in starting the treatment of AMI with pPCI when compared to the  recommended time, which requires an action plan in the near future to ensure  earlier treatment for our patients.},

  abstract = {The notion that psychological states can influence physical health is hardly new, and perhaps nowhere has the mind-body connection been better studied than in  cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, large prospective epidemiologic studies  and smaller basic science studies have firmly established a connection between  CVD and several psychological conditions, including depression, chronic  psychological stress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety. In  addition, numerous clinical trials have been conducted to attempt to prevent or  lessen the impact of these conditions on cardiovascular health. In this article,  we review studies connecting depression, stress/PTSD, and anxiety to CVD,  focusing on findings from the last 5 years. For each mental health condition, we  first examine the epidemiologic evidence establishing a link with CVD. We then  describe studies of potential underlying mechanisms and finally discuss treatment  trials and directions for future research.},

The  WHO considers that the classification should be developed in consultation with  stakeholders, which include WHO member countries, multidisciplinary health  professionals, and users of mental health services and their families. Attention  to the cultural framework must be a key element in defining future classification  concepts. Uses of the ICD that must be considered include clinical applications,  research, teaching and training, health statistics, and public health. The  Advisory Group has determined that the current revision represents a particular  opportunity to improve the classification's clinical utility, particularly in  global primary care settings where there is the greatest opportunity to identify  people who need mental health treatment. Based on WHO's mission and constitution,  the usefulness of the classification in helping WHO member countries,  particularly low- and middle-income countries, to reduce the disease burden  associated with mental disorders is among the highest priorities for the  revision.

However, given the number of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI)  performed worldwide every year, ST and ISR, albeit occurring at a fairly low  rate, represent a public health problem even with contemporary DES platforms. The  understanding of mechanisms and risk factors for these two PCI complications has  been of fundamental importance for the parallel evolution of stent technologies.  Risk factors associated with ST and ISR are usually divided into patient-,  lesion-, device- and procedure-related. A number of studies have shown how  certain risk factors are related to early (1 month) versus late/very late ST  (between 1 month and 1 year and {$>$}1 year, respectively). However, more research is  required to conclusively show the role of time-dependence of risk factors also in  the incidence of ISR (early [1 year] or late [{$>$}1 year]). A thorough risk  assessment is required due to the complex etiology of ST and ISR. The most  effective strategy to treat ST and ISR is still to prevent them; hence, it is  crucial to identify patient-, lesion-, device- and procedure-related predictors.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The impact of sex on coronary artery disease prognosis is debated. It has been postulated that women receive less prompt treatment compared with  men, potentially adversely affecting their prognosis by significantly increasing  the risk of morbidity and mortality. We aim to investigate the influence of sex  on the timing and clinical outcomes of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction  (STEMI) patients using a controlled Swiss registry. METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on  the Fribourg STEMI Fast Track Registry, 1177 patients (288 women, 889 men) with  {$>$}12 months clinical follow-up were selected. Women had longer first medical  contact to reperfusion times (1.31 (1.14-2.00) vs 1.27 (1.09-1.54)\,hours,  p=0.035) but similar total ischaemic times (3.04 (2.15-4.50) vs 2.56  (2.07-4.38)\,hours, p=0.064). Men had higher rates of diabetes, smoking and  dyslipidaemia, while women had higher hypertension and renal insufficiency rates.  No significant sex differences in clinical outcomes were observed at 1-year and  5-year follow-ups. DISCUSSION: The study found sex differences in patient  profiles and minor treatment delays for women, which did not significantly affect  outcomes. Efforts to improve sex equity in STEMI care are effective, as no  significant outcome differences were observed. Disparities are more related to  patient characteristics than sex. CONCLUSION: Despite slight delays and different  risk profiles for women with STEMI, clinical outcomes are similar between sexes.  Ongoing efforts are needed to ensure sex equity in acute coronary syndrome  management. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04185285.},

It is designed to assess the effect of coronary artery bypass surgery on  mortality and selected nonfatal end points. From August 1975 to May 1979, 780  patients with stable ischemic heart disease were randomly assigned to receive  surgical (n = 390) or nonsurgical (n = 390) treatment and were followed through  April 15, 1983. At 5 years, the average annual mortality rate in patients  assigned to surgical treatment was 1.1\%. The annual mortality rate in those  receiving medical therapy was 1.6\%. Annual mortality rates in patients with  single-, double-, and triple-vessel disease who were in the surgical group were  0.7\%, 1.0\%, and 1.5\%; the corresponding rates in patients in the medical group  were 1.4\%, 1.2\%, and 2.1\%. The differences were not statistically significant.  Nearly 75\% of the patients had entry ejection fractions of at least 0.50. The  annual mortality rates in patients in the surgical group in this subgroup with  single-, double-, and triple-vessel disease were 0.8\%, 0.8\%, and 1.2\% and  corresponding rates in the medical group were 1.1\%, 0.6\%, and 1.2\%. The annual  rate of bypass surgery in patients who were initially assigned to receive medical  treatment was 4.7\%. The excellent survival rates observed both in CASS patients  assigned to receive medical and those assigned to receive surgical therapy and  the similarity of survival rates in the two groups of patients in this randomized  trial lead to the conclusion that patients similar to those enrolled in this  trial can safely defer bypass surgery until symptoms worsen to the point that  surgical palliation is required.},

METHODS: Patients from a multinational  database were randomly selected for the study of agreement, according to sample  size calculation. Both conventional 3D-QFR and mQFR were analyzed for all  available arteries at a central corelab by independent analysts, blinded to each  other's results. RESULTS: Ninety-eight coronary arteries from 35 patients were  finally analyzed. Median 3D-QFR was 0.82 (interquartile range 0.78-0.87). The  intraclass correlation coefficient for the absolute agreement between 3D-QFR and  mQFR was 0.996 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.993-0.997); Lin's coefficient  0.996 (95\% CI: 0.993-0.997), without constant or proportional bias (intercept = 0  and slope = 1 in orthogonal regression). As dichotomous variable, there was  absolute agreement between mQFR and 3D-QFR, resulting in no single false positive  or negative. Kappa index was 1 and the diagnostic accuracy 100\%. CONCLUSIONS:  mQFR using a single angiographic projection showed almost perfect agreement with  standard 3D-QFR. These results encourage the interchangeable use of mQFR and  3D-QFR, which can be interesting to improve QFR feasibility in retrospective  studies, wherein appropriate double angiographic projections might be challenging  to obtain.},

To date,  several devices have been compared with drug-eluting stents (DESs) in this  setting with different outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to compare the  short- and long-term performance of the paclitaxel DCB with the  everolimus-eluting stent in patients with de novo lesions in small coronary  vessel disease. METHODS: PICCOLETO II (Drug Eluting Balloon Efficacy for Small  Coronary Vessel Disease Treatment) was an academic, international,  investigator-driven, multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial in which  patients were allocated to a DCB (n~=~118) or DES (n~=~114). We previously  reported the superiority of DCBs regarding in-lesion late lumen loss at 6~months.  Herein we report the final 3-year clinical follow-up with the occurrence of major  adverse cardiac events (MACEs), a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial  infarction, target lesion revascularization, and its individual components.  RESULTS: The 3-year clinical follow-up (median 1,101~days; IQR: 1,055-1,146~days)  was available for 102 patients allocated to DCB and 101 to DES treatment. The  cumulative rate of all-cause death (4\% vs 3.9\%; P = 0.98), cardiac death (1\% vs  1.9\%; P = 0.56), myocardial infarction (6.9\% vs 2\%; P = 0.14), and target lesion  revascularization (14.8\% vs 8.8\%; P = 0.18) did not significantly differ between  DCBs and DESs. MACEs and acute vessel occlusion occurred more frequently in the  DES group (20.8\% vs 10.8\% [P = 0.046] and 4\% vs 0\% [P = 0.042], respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: The long-term clinical follow-up of the PICCOLETO II randomized  clinical trial shows a higher risk of MACEs in patients with de novo lesions in  small vessel disease when they are treated with the current-generation DES  compared with the new-generation paclitaxel DCB.

BACKGROUND: Clinical data and international guidelines recommend the use of intravascular imaging ultrasound (IVUS) to guide left main (LM) angioplasty. Despite early experience using OCT in this setting is encouraging, the evidence supporting its use is still limited. METHODS: ROCK II is a multicenter, investigator-driven, retrospective European study to compare the performance of IVUS and OCT versus angiography in patients undergoing distal-LM stenting. The primary study endpoint was target-lesion failure (TLF) including cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction and target-lesion revascularization. We designed this study hypothesizing the superiority of intravascular imaging over angiographic guidance alone, and the non-inferiority of OCT versus IVUS. RESULTS: A total of 730 patients, 377 with intravascular-imaging guidance (162 OCT, 215 IVUS) and 353 with angiographic guidance, were analyzed. The one-year rate of TLF was 21.2\% with angiography and 12.7\% with intravascular-imaging (p\,=~0.039), with no difference between OCT and IVUS (p\,=~0.26). Intravascular-imaging was predictor of freedom from TLF (HR 0.46; 95\% CI 0.23-0.93: p\,=~0.03). Propensity-score matching identified three groups of 100 patients each with no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The one-year rate of TLF was 16\% in the angiographic, 7\% in the OCT and 6\% in the IVUS group, respectively (p\,=~0.03 for IVUS or OCT vs. angiography). No between-group significant differences in the rate of individual components of TLF were found. CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular imaging was superior to angiography for distal LM stenting, with no difference between OCT and IVUS.},

BACKGROUND: The use of  DEB in diffuse CAD, either alone or in combination with DES, offers an  alternative to stenting alone. Data regarding DEB in this context are limited.  METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all patients treated with DEB for diffuse  CAD between June 2009 and October 2012. Endpoints analyzed were major adverse  cardiac events, defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target  vessel revascularization (TVR), as well as TVR and target lesion  revascularization separately. Results were compared with those obtained from a  cohort of patients with similar characteristics treated with DES alone. RESULTS:  A total of 69 patients (93 lesions) were treated with DEB {\textpm} DES, and 93 patients  with DES alone (93 lesions). A high proportion of patients were diabetic (46.4\%  vs. 44.1\%, p~= 0.77). Of the DEB-treated lesions, 56.0\% were treated with DEB  alone, 7.4\% with DEB and DES as bail out, and 36.6\% with DES and DEB as part of a  hybrid approach for very long disease. Outcome rates with DEB {\textpm} DES were  comparable to those with DES alone at 2-year follow-up (major adverse cardiac  events~= 20.8\% vs. 22.7\%, p~= 0.74; TVR~= 14.8\% vs. 11.5\%, p~= 0.44; target  lesion revascularization~= 9.6\% vs. 9.3\%, p~= 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: DEB may have a  role in the treatment of diffuse de novo CAD, either alone in smaller vessels or  in combination with DES in very long disease.},

The time needed to stand 10 times from a standard chair was recorded in 139 healthy subjects, aged 20 to 85 years (77 men, 62 women). Reproducibility was 6.8 percent (+/- 3.4 percent). Neither height nor weight was related to time in either sex. Weight was related to time (p less than 0.05) after adjusting for age, but this effect was slight compared with the effect of age alone. A highly significant (p less than 0.0001) relationship between time and age was found in both sexes. Younger men performed better than younger women, although this difference was lost in the older age groups. The results of this simple test correlated well with published data on the strength of knee flexor and extensor muscles in groups of men and women of various ages. This method was used to evaluate serially six consecutive patients with classic polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Improvement after treatment with prednisone used alone or in combination with azathioprine or methotrexate was found in all cases.},

ANIMALS: 10 dogs with cutaneous MCT and 10 dogs with soft tissue sarcoma (STS). PROCEDURES: The study consisted of 2 phases. First, 2 canine MCT cell lines were exposed to 3 pharmacologically relevant morphine concentrations, and histamine concentrations were determined by an ELISA. Second, dogs with MCT or STS received 0.5 mg of morphine/kg, IM, before surgery for tumor excision. Clinical signs, respiratory rate, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rectal temperature, and plasma histamine concentrations were recorded before and 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after morphine administration but prior to surgery. Data were compared by use of a 2-way ANOVA with the Sidak multiple comparisons test. RESULTS: In the first phase, canine MCT cell lines did not release histamine when exposed to pharmacologically relevant morphine concentrations. In the second phase, no differences were noted for heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and rectal temperature between MCT and STS groups. Plasma histamine concentrations did not significantly differ over time within groups and between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: No significant changes in histamine concentrations were noted for both in vitro and in vivo study phases, and no hemodynamic changes were noted for the in vivo study phase. These preliminary results suggested that morphine may be used safely in some dogs with MCT.},

The P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12) plays a central role in amplifying platelet aggregation, dense granule and {$\alpha$}-granule secretion, P-selectin expression, microparticle formation, and procoagulant membrane changes, regardless of the activating stimulus. We hypothesized that P2Y12 deficiency might reduce the vessel wall response to vascular injury as well as thrombosis in murine vascular injury models. Methods and Results--- P2Y12-deficient (-/-) mice and littermate controls (+/+) were bred on a C57 BL/6 background. In vivo murine models of arterial injury were employed alone and in combination with bone marrow transplantation to investigate the role of P2Y12 in the vessel wall response to arterial injury and thrombosis. At 21 days after ferric chloride injury, neointima formation in P2Y12-/- arteries was significantly less than that observed in control strain arteries (P\&lt;0.025). In agreement with this, the intima-media ratio was significantly greater in femoral wire-injured arteries from P2Y12+/+ compared with P2Y12-/- animals (P\&lt;0.05). Bone marrow transplantation was used to examine the importance of vessel wall P2Y12 versus platelet P2Y12. Analysis of arterial sections from chimeric animals at 21 days after injury revealed a smaller intima-media ratio in -/- to +/+ animals than in the positive (+/+ to +/+) control group (P\&lt;0.01). Conclusions--- These data demonstrate a role for platelet P2Y12 in the vessel wall response to arterial injury and thrombosis. This illustrates the manner in which platelets may contribute to atherogenesis and restenosis.}

METHODS: All patients treated with SCB between July 2012 and September  2015 were enrolled at Indian centres and clinically followed for 1, 3, 6 and  12\,months post-procedure. Primary endpoints were procedural success and  device-oriented adverse cardiac events (DOCE) at 12\,months. DOCE were defined as  a composite of cardiac death, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target  vessel-myocardial infarction. RESULTS: A total of 394 SCB were used in 332  patients to treat 356 lesions. In-stent restenosis and small coronary vessel  disease occurred in 46\% and 43\% of the patients respectively. Mean balloon length  and diameter (average\,{\textpm}\,SD) were 21.83\,{\textpm}\,6.70\,mm and 2.69\,{\textpm}\,0.45\,mm respectively.  All patients with 1\,year follow-up were included. Overall DOCE rate was 4.2\%  (n\,=\,14) which included death 0.3\% (n\,=\,1), TLR 3.6\% (n\,=\,12) and myocardial  infarction 0.3\% (n\,=\,1). CONCLUSION: The Nanolut{\'e} prospective registry, is the  first clinical evidence of the safety and feasibility of this type of SCB, both  in patients with in-stent restenosis or de novo lesions.},

However, current estimates of its natural history and prevalence are based on historical studies with potential sources of bias. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of VHD identified at recruitment of a large cohort of older people. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 2500 individuals aged {$\geq$}65 years from a primary care population and screened for undiagnosed VHD using transthoracic echocardiography. Newly identified (predominantly mild) VHD was detected in 51\% of participants. The most common abnormalities were aortic sclerosis (34\%), mitral regurgitation (22\%), and aortic regurgitation (15\%). Aortic stenosis was present in 1.3\%. The likelihood of undiagnosed VHD was two-fold higher in the two most deprived socioeconomic quintiles than in the most affluent quintile, and three-fold higher in individuals with atrial fibrillation. Clinically significant (moderate or severe) undiagnosed VHD was identified in 6.4\%. In addition, 4.9\% of the cohort had pre-existing VHD (a total prevalence of 11.3\%). Projecting these findings using population data, we estimate that the prevalence of clinically significant VHD will double before 2050. CONCLUSIONS: Previously undetected VHD affects 1 in 2 of the elderly population and is more common in lower socioeconomic classes. These unique data demonstrate the contemporary clinical and epidemiological characteristics of VHD in a large population-based cohort of older people and confirm the scale of the emerging epidemic of VHD, with widespread implications for clinicians and healthcare resources.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the advantages, limitations, ethical considerations, future prospects, and practical applications of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare and medical domains. ChatGPT is an advanced language model that uses deep learning techniques to produce human-like responses to natural language inputs. It is part of the family of generative pre-training transformer (GPT) models developed by OpenAI and is currently one of the largest publicly available language models. ChatGPT is capable of capturing the nuances and intricacies of human language, allowing it to generate appropriate and contextually relevant responses across a broad spectrum of prompts. The potential applications of ChatGPT in the medical field range from identifying potential research topics to assisting professionals in clinical and laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, it can be used to help medical students, doctors, nurses, and all members of the healthcare fraternity to know about updates and new developments in their respective fields. The development of virtual assistants to aid patients in managing their health is another important application of ChatGPT in medicine. Despite its potential applications, the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools in medical writing also poses ethical and legal concerns. These include possible infringement of copyright laws, medico-legal complications, and the need for transparency in AI-generated content. In conclusion, ChatGPT has several potential applications in the medical and healthcare fields. However, these applications come with several limitations and ethical considerations which are presented in detail along with future prospects in medicine and healthcare.}

  abstract = {Since it was first reported in 1912, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has become the leading cause of death in the Western world. Several improvements that have been made over the years in the pharmacological treatment of ACS have reduced the relative risk of death due to myocardial infarction from 35-45\% previously to approximately 3.5\% at present. Universities,~websites, and educational videos commonly use a mnemonic for morphine, oxygen, nitrates, and aspirin (MONA) to refer to the adjuvant treatment used for the management of ACS. We review the scientific data pertaining to treatment strategies for the management of ACS and discuss whether MONA remains relevant in the present scenario. While using morphine and oxygen is associated with risks such as higher mortality and increase in the size of the infarct, respectively, several available drugs such as fibrinolytics, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors, and statins are known to be useful to treat ACS. MONA should be viewed as an obsolete teaching and learning aid, and therefore we recommend that its use~be discontinued for the management of ACS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to create a practical score for risk stratification in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary angioplasty and to assess the feasibility of early discharge in low-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prognostic score was built according to 30-day mortality rates in 1791 patients undergoing primary angioplasty for STEMI. For the identified low-risk patients without any contraindication to early discharge, we estimated and compared the costs of conventional care (prolonged 24-hour hospitalization) with the costs of shifting the care from inpatient to outpatient setting (early discharge) between 48 and 72 hours. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality included in the score were age, anterior infarction, Killip class, ischemic time, postprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow, and multivessel disease. This score was able to identify a large cohort (73.4\%) of low-risk (score {$<$} or =3) patients, with a good discriminatory capacity (c statistic=0.907). The mortality rate was 0.1\% at 2 days and 0.2\% between 2 and 10 days in patients with a score {$<$} or =3. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for late discharge in low-risk patients was estimated at 1949.33. Therefore, this policy would save 1 life per 1097 low-risk patients, at additional costs of 194 933.33, in comparison with an early discharge policy. CONCLUSIONS: This score is a practical and useful index for risk stratification after primary angioplasty for STEMI, with a significant impact on clinical decision-making and the related costs. It reliably identifies a large group of patients at very low risk, who may safely be discharged early after primary angioplasty.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the relationship between mortality and time delay to treatment has been demonstrated in patients with acute ST-segment elevation  myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by thrombolysis, the impact of time delay  on prognosis in patients undergoing primary angioplasty has yet to be clarified.  The aim of this report was to address the relationship between time to treatment  and mortality as a continuous function and to estimate the risk of mortality for  each 30-minute delay. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1791  patients with STEMI treated by primary angioplasty. The relationship between  ischemic time and 1-year mortality was assessed as a continuous function and  plotted with a quadratic regression model. The Cox proportional hazards  regression model was used to calculate relative risks (for each 30 minutes of  delay), adjusted for baseline characteristics related to ischemic time. Variables  related to time to treatment were age {$>$}70 years (P{$<$}0.0001), female gender  (P=0.004), presence of diabetes mellitus (P=0.002), and previous  revascularization (P=0.035). Patients with successful reperfusion had a  significantly shorter ischemic time (P=0.006). A total of 103 patients (5.8\%) had  died at 1-year follow-up. After adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and  previous revascularization, each 30 minutes of delay was associated with a  relative risk for 1-year mortality of 1.075 (95\% CI 1.008 to 1.15; P=0.041).  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that every minute of delay in primary  angioplasty for STEMI affects 1-year mortality, even after adjustment for  baseline characteristics. Therefore, all efforts should be made to shorten the  total ischemic time, not only for thrombolytic therapy but also for primary  angioplasty.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess variations in decisions to revascularise patients with coronary heart disease between general cardiologists, interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons DESIGN: Six cases of coronary heart disease were presented at an open meeting in a standard format including clinical details which might influence the decision to revascularise. Clinicians (n = 53) were then asked to vote using an anonymous electronic system for one of 5 treatment options: medical, surgical (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or initially medical proceeding to revascularisation if symptoms dictated. Each case was then discussed in an open forum following which clinicians were asked to revote. Differences in treatment preference were compared by chi squared test and agreement between groups and between voting rounds compared using Kappa. RESULTS: Surgeons were more likely to choose surgery as a form of treatment (p = 0.034) while interventional cardiologists were more likely to choose PCI (p = 0.056). There were no significant differences between non-interventional and interventional cardiologists (p = 0.13) in their choice of treatment. There was poor agreement between all clinicians in the first round of voting (Kappa 0.26) but this improved to a moderate level of agreement after open discussion for the second vote (Kappa 0.44). The level of agreement among surgeons (0.15) was less than that for cardiologists (0.34) in Round 1, but was similar in Round 2 (0.45 and 0.45 respectively). CONCLUSION: In this case series, there was poor agreement between cardiac clinical specialists in the choice of treatment offered to patients. Open discussion appeared to improve agreement. These results would support the need for decisions to revascularise to be made by a multidisciplinary panel.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: International research indicates that attendance of patients to a proposed cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme varies between 21\% and 75\%.  Addressing the reasons why cardiac patients are not participating will improve  accessibility to CR. The objective of this study was to investigate patient  compliance with cardiac rehabilitation and the reasons of refusing or abandoning  the programme. METHODS: Twenty hospital centres were recruited to participate.  Each centre was asked to recruit patients from three patient groups, namely:  percutaneous coronary intervention patients, patients that underwent major  cardiac surgery, and patients being admitted because of an acute myocardial  infarction and not belonging to the other two groups. Patients were asked to fill  out a questionnaire during a follow-up outpatient consultation after the cardiac  intervention. RESULTS: In total, 226 patients participated in the survey. Most  patients were proposed (86\%) and accepted (81\% out of proposed) to attend a CR  programme. Of those who accepted, 77\% completed the programme. The main reasons  that led to patients' refusal to participate in a CR programme were distance to  the CR centre, patients' belief they could handle their own problems, and lack of  time. The main three reasons for not completing an initiated CR programme were  other physical problems, patients' belief they could handle their own problems,  and the cost of rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate the  importance of raising patients' awareness of the benefits of CR. Addressing  potential barriers to attend a CR programme should be investigated with patients  individually in order to ensure compliance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extent to which infarct artery impacts the extent of myocardial injury and outcomes in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction  (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention is uncertain.  METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a pooled analysis using individual patient data  from 7 randomized STEMI trials in which myocardial injury within 30\,days after  primary percutaneous coronary intervention was assessed in 1774 patients by  cardiac magnetic resonance (n=1318) or technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon  emission computed tomography (n=456). Clinical follow-up was performed at a  median duration of 351\,days (interquartile range, 184-368\,days). Infarct size and  outcomes were assessed in anterior (infarct vessel=left anterior descending)  versus nonanterior (non-left anterior descending) STEMI. Median infarct size  (percentage left ventricular myocardial mass) was larger in patients with  anterior compared with nonanterior STEMI (19.7\% [interquartile range, 9.4\%-31.7\%]  versus 12.6\% [interquartile range, 5.1\%-20.5\%]; P{$<$}0.001). Patients with anterior  compared with nonanterior STEMI were at higher risk for 1-year all-cause  mortality (6.2\% versus 3.6\%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.66 [95\% CI,  1.02-2.69]; P=0.04) and heart failure hospitalization (4.4\% versus 2.6\%; adjusted  HR, 1.96 [95\% CI, 1.15-3.36]; P=0.01). Infarct size was a predictor of subsequent  all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization in anterior STEMI (adjusted  HR per 1\% increase, 1.05 [95\% CI, 1.03-1.07]; P{$<$}0.001), but not in nonanterior  STEMI (adjusted HR, 1.02 [95\% CI, 0.99-1.05]; P=0.19). The P value for this  interaction was 0.04. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior STEMI was associated with  substantially greater myonecrosis after primary percutaneous coronary  intervention compared with nonanterior STEMI, contributing in large part to the  worse prognosis in patients with anterior infarction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to study effectiveness, survival, and complications after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in patients with cirrhosis and symptomatic refractory hepatic hydrothorax. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TIPS between January 1992 and December 2008 for refractory hydrothorax were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical, laboratory, and procedural data were collected for all patients by retrospective chart review. Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables and t-test to compare continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included in the study, and their mean age at TIPS creation was 55.62 years (s.d. 11.65). The mean pre- and post-TIPS portosystemic gradients were 18.9 (s.d. 4.7) mm Hg and 5.7 (s.d. 2.4) mm Hg (P{$<$}0.001), respectively. The rates of favorable clinical response within 1 month and at 6 months after TIPS were 79\% (58/73) and 75\% (30/40), respectively. Median survival of the study group was 517 days (95\% CI 11-626). The short-term survival rates at 30, 60, and 90 days were 81, 78, and 72\%, respectively. The long-term survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 48, 26, and 15\%, respectively. Multivariate analysis by Cox proportional hazards method showed that pre-TIPS model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (P=0.039, HR 1.9 (95\% CI 1.0-3.7)) and clinical response (P=0.003, HR 2.5 (95\% CI 1.4-4.5)) were significantly and independently associated with overall survival. The 30-day mortality rate was 19\%. Pre-TIPS creatinine levels (P=0.024, HR 3.42 (95\% CI 1.2-9.9)) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: TIPS can be successfully used to achieve symptomatic relief in patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax. Better clinical response after TIPS and pre-TIPS MELD score less than 15 were associated with longer survival after TIPS.},

SBE is a distinct and often underdiagnosed complication having different pathogenesis and treatment strategy when compared with parapneumonic empyema. Hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites is rare in patients with cirrhosis. The occurrence of SBE without SBP or ascites is even more of a rarity in cirrhosis and carries great morbidity and mortality. Here we report a case of an elderly female patient with cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class B) who had unusual features of isolated right-sided hepatic hydrothorax without clinically evident ascites and was later diagnosed as having SBE based on imaging of the thorax, pleural fluid analysis, and cultures. The patient was initially treated conservatively with antibiotics, and diuretics, and later pigtail insertion and drainage was done.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death globally. However, with falling CHD mortality rates, an increasing number of  people living with CHD~may need support to manage their symptoms and prognosis.  Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) aims to improve the health and  outcomes of people with CHD. This is an update of a Cochrane Review previously  published in 2016. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and  cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR (exercise training alone or in  combination with psychosocial or educational interventions) compared with 'no  exercise' control, on mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life  (HRQoL) in people with CHD. SEARCH METHODS: We updated searches from the previous  Cochrane Review, by searching CENTRAL,~MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases  in September 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers in June 2021.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of  exercise-based interventions with at least six months' follow-up, compared  with~'no exercise' control. The study population comprised adult men and women  who have had a myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), or have angina pectoris, or coronary  artery disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened all identified  references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane  methods. We stratified meta-analysis by duration of follow-up:~short-term (6 to  12 months); medium-term ({$>$} 12 to 36 months); and long-term ( {$>$} 3 years), and used  meta-regression to explore potential treatment effect modifiers. We used GRADE  for primary outcomes at 6 to 12 months (the most common follow-up time point).~  MAIN RESULTS: This review included 85 trials which randomised 23,430 people with  CHD. This latest update identified 22 new trials (7795 participants). The  population included predominantly post-MI and post-revascularisation patients,  with a~mean age~ranging~from 47 to 77 years. In the last decade, the median  percentage of women with CHD has increased from 11\% to 17\%, but females still  account for a similarly small~percentage of participants recruited overall ( {$<$}  15\%). Twenty-one of the included trials were performed in low- and middle-income  countries (LMICs). Overall trial reporting was poor, although there was evidence  of an improvement in quality~over the last decade. The median longest follow-up  time was 12 months (range 6 months to 19 years). At short-term follow-up (6 to 12  months), exercise-based CR likely results in a slight reduction in all-cause  mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.04; 25  trials; moderate certainty evidence), a large reduction in MI (RR 0.72, 95\% CI  0.55 to 0.93; 22 trials; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial  outcome (NNTB) 75, 95\% CI 47 to 298; high certainty evidence), and a large  reduction in all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.77; 14 trials;  NNTB 12, 95\% CI 9 to 21; moderate certainty evidence). Exercise-based CR likely  results in little~to no difference in risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.88,  95\% CI 0.68 to 1.14; 15 trials; moderate certainty evidence), CABG (RR 0.99, 95\%  CI 0.78 to 1.27; 20 trials; high certainty evidence), and PCI (RR 0.86, 95\% CI  0.63 to 1.19; 13 trials; moderate certainty evidence) up to 12 months' follow-up.  We are uncertain about the effects of exercise-based CR on cardiovascular  hospitalisation,~with a wide confidence interval including considerable benefit  as well as harm (RR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.41 to 1.59; low certainty evidence). There was  evidence of substantial heterogeneity across trials for cardiovascular  hospitalisations (I(2) = 53\%), and~of small study bias for all-cause  hospitalisation, but not for all other outcomes. At medium-term  follow-up,~although there may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality  (RR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.02; 15 trials), MI (RR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 12  trials), PCI (RR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.69 to 1.35; 6 trials), CABG (RR 0.97, 95\% CI 0.77  to 1.23; 9 trials), and all-cause hospitalisation~(RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.82 to 1.03;  9 trials), a large reduction in cardiovascular mortality was found (RR 0.77, 95\%  CI 0.63 to 0.93; 5 trials). Evidence is uncertain for difference in risk of  cardiovascular hospitalisation~(RR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.76 to 1.12; 3 trials). At  long-term follow-up, although there may be little to no difference in all-cause  mortality (RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.10), exercise-based CR may result in a large  reduction in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.78; 8 trials)  and MI (RR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.50 to 0.90; 10 trials). Evidence is uncertain for CABG  (RR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.34 to 1.27; 4 trials), and PCI (RR 0.76, 95\% CI 0.48 to 1.20;  3 trials). Meta-regression showed benefits in outcomes were independent of CHD  case mix, type of CR, exercise dose, follow-up length, publication year, CR  setting, study location, sample size or risk of bias. There was evidence that  exercise-based CR may slightly increase HRQoL across several subscales (SF-36  mental component, physical functioning, physical performance, general health,  vitality, social functioning and mental health scores) up to 12 months'  follow-up; however, these may not be clinically important differences. The eight  trial-based economic evaluation studies showed exercise-based CR to be~a  potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted  life years (QALYs). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This updated Cochrane Review supports  the conclusions of the previous version,~that~exercise-based CR provides  important benefits to people with CHD, including reduced risk of MI, a likely  small reduction in all-cause mortality, and a large reduction in all-cause  hospitalisation, along with associated healthcare costs, and improved HRQoL up to  12 months' follow-up. Over longer-term follow-up, benefits may include reductions  in cardiovascular mortality and MI. In the last decade, trials were more likely  to include females, and be undertaken in LMICs, increasing the generalisability  of findings. Well-designed,~adequately-reported RCTs of CR in~people with CHD  more representative of usual clinical practice are still needed. Trials should  explicitly report clinical outcomes, including mortality and hospital admissions,  and include validated HRQoL outcome measures, especially over longer-term  follow-up, and assess costs and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been demonstrated in some studies to predict long-term coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency. Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is an emerging technology which may predict FFR. In this study, we hypothesised that QFR would predict long-term CABG patency and that QFR would offer superior diagnostic performance to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). METHODS: A prospective study was performed on patients with left main coronary artery disease who were undergoing CABG. QFR, QCA and IVUS assessment was performed. Follow-up computed tomography coronary angiography and invasive coronary angiography was undertaken to assess graft patency. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients, comprising of 65 vessels were included in the analysis. At a median follow-up of 3.6~years post CABG (interquartile range, 2.3 to 4.8~years), 12 grafts (18.4\%) were occluded. QFR was not statistically significantly higher in occluded grafts (0.81\,{\textpm}\,0.19 vs. 0.69\,{\textpm}\,0.21; P\,=\,0.08). QFR demonstrated a discriminatory power to predict graft occlusion (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.70; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.88; P\,=\,0.03). At long-term follow-up, the risk of graft occlusion was higher in vessels with a QFR\,{$>$}\,0.80 (58.6\% vs. 17.0\%; hazard ratio, 3.89; 95\% CI, 1.05 to 14.42; P\,=\,0.03 by log-rank test). QCA (minimum lumen diameter, lesion length, diameter stenosis) and IVUS (minimum lumen area, minimum lumen diameter, diameter stenosis) parameters were not predictive of long-term graft patency. CONCLUSIONS: QFR may predict long-term graft patency in patients undergoing CABG.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exCR) increases aerobic capacity and improves outcomes in patients following myocardial  infarction (MI) and is therefore universally recommended. While meta-analyses  consistently report that participation in exCR reduces cardiovascular mortality,  there are conflicting results regarding effects on total mortality. Presently,  many eligible patients do not receive exCR in clinical practice. We aimed to  investigate the relation between participation in exCR post-MI and total  mortality in men and women in a nationwide real-world cohort from the SWEDEHEART  registry. DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational cohort study. METHODS AND RESULTS:  In total, 20 895 patients from the SWEDEHEART registry were included. Mortality  data were obtained from the Swedish National Population Registry. During a mean  of 4.55 ({\textpm}2.33) years of follow-up, 1000 patients died. Using Cox regression for  proportional odds and taking a wide range of potential confounders into  consideration, participation in exCR was related to significantly lower total  mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 95\% confidence interval 0.62-0.83]. Excluding  patients with shorter follow-up than 2\,years did not alter the results.  Exercise-based CR participation was related to lowered total mortality in most of  the investigated subgroups. The risk reduction was more pronounced in women than  in men (HR 0.54 vs. 0.81, respectively). CONCLUSION: Participation in exCR was  associated with reduced total mortality, and more pronounced in women, compared  with men. Our results further support the recommendations to participate in exCR,  and hence we argue that exCR should be a mandatory part of comprehensive CR  programmes, offered to all patients post-MI.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is the most common metabolic complication of malignancies, but its incidence may be declining due to potent chemotherapeutic agents. The high mortality associated with HCM has declined markedly due to the introduction of increasingly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. Despite the widespread availability of efficacious medications to treat HCM, evidence-based recommendations to manage this debilitating condition are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To develop guidelines for the treatment of adults with HCM. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, together with experts in systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 8 clinical questions related to the treatment of HCM in adult patients. The systematic reviews (SRs) queried electronic databases for studies relevant to the selected questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. An independent SR was conducted in parallel to assess patients' and physicians' values and preferences, costs, resources needed, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and other domains relevant to the Evidence-to-Decision framework as well as to enable judgements and recommendations. RESULTS: The panel recommends (strong recommendation) in adults with HCM treatment with denosumab (Dmab) or an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate (BP). The following recommendations were based on low certainty of the evidence. The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) (1) in adults with HCM, the use of Dmab rather than an IV BP; (2) in adults with severe HCM, a combination of calcitonin and an IV BP or Dmab therapy as initial treatment; and (3) in adults with refractory/recurrent HCM despite treatment with BP, the use of Dmab. The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) the addition of an IV BP or Dmab in adult patients with hypercalcemia due to tumors associated with high calcitriol levels who are already receiving glucocorticoid therapy but continue to have severe or symptomatic HCM. The panel suggests (conditional recommendation) in adult patients with hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma, treatment with either a calcimimetic or an antiresorptive (IV BP or Dmab). The panel judges the treatments as probably accessible and feasible for most recommendations but noted variability in costs, resources required, and their impact on equity. CONCLUSIONS: The panel's recommendations are based on currently available evidence considering the most important outcomes in HCM to patients and key stakeholders. Treatment of the primary malignancy is instrumental for controlling hypercalcemia and preventing its recurrence. The recommendations provide a framework for the medical management of adults with HCM and incorporate important decisional and contextual factors. The guidelines underscore current knowledge gaps that can be used to establish future research agendas.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) occurs as a result of rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries. Limited data exist  regarding the impact of culprit coronary vessel on hard clinical event rates.  This study investigated the impact of culprit vessel on outcomes after primary  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of STEMI. METHODS: A total of 29 832  previously cardiac healthy patients who underwent primary PCI between 2003 and  2014 were prospectively included from the Swedish Coronary Angiography and  Angioplasty Registry and the Registry of Information and Knowledge about Swedish  Heart Intensive care Admissions. Patients were stratified into three groups based  on culprit vessel (right coronary artery (RCA), left anterior descending artery  (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx)). The primary outcome was 1-year  mortality. The secondary outcomes included 30-day and 5-year mortality, as well  as heart failure, stroke, bleeding and myocardial reinfarction at 30 days, 1 year  and 5 years. Univariable and multivariable analyses were done using Cox  regression models. RESULTS: One-year analyses revealed that LAD infarctions had  the highest increased risk of death, heart failure and stroke compared with RCA  infarctions, which had the lowest risk. Sensitivity analyses revealed that  reduced left ventricular ejection fraction on discharge partially explained this  increased relative risk in mortality. Furthermore, landmark analyses revealed  that culprit vessel had no significant influence on 1-year mortality if a patient  survived 30 days after myocardial infarction. Subgroup analyses revealed female  sex and multivessel disease (MVD) as significant high-risk groups with respect to  1-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: LAD and LCx infarctions had a relatively higher  adjusted mortality rate compared with RCA infarctions, with LAD infarctions in  particular being associated with an increased risk of heart failure, stroke and  death. Culprit vessel had limited influence on mortality after 1 month. High-risk  patient groups include LAD infarctions in women or with concomitant MVD.},

This study sought to  define the prognostic role of pancoronary QFR assessment in patients with acute  coronary syndrome (ACS) including postinterventional culprit and nonculprit  vessels. METHODS: In a total of 792 patients with ACS (48.6\% ST-segment-elevation  ACS and 51.4\% non-ST-segment-elevation ACS), QFR analyses of postinterventional  culprit (n=792 vessels) and nonculprit vessels (n=1231 vessels) were post hoc  performed by investigators blinded to clinical outcomes. The follow-up comprised  of major adverse cardiovascular events, including all-cause mortality, nonfatal  myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven coronary revascularization within 2  years after the index ACS event. RESULTS: Major adverse cardiovascular events as  composite end point occurred in 99 patients (12.5\%). QFR with an optimal cutoff  value of 0.89 for postinterventional culprit vessels and 0.85 for nonculprit  vessels emerged as independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events  after ACS (nonculprit arteries: adjusted odds ratio, 3.78 [95\% CI, 2.21-6.45],  P{$<$}0.001 and postpercutaneous coronary intervention culprit arteries: adjusted  odds ratio, 3.60 [95\% CI, 2.09-6.20], P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study  for the first time demonstrates the prognostic implications of a pancoronary  angiography-based functional lesion assessment in patients with ACS. Hence, QFR  offers a novel tool to advance risk stratification and guide therapeutic  management after ACS.},

In addition,  over the last 5 years we have witnessed a shift towards the use of physiology to  enhance procedural planning, assess post-PCI functional results, and guide PCI  optimisation. In this regard, clinical studies have reported compelling data  supporting the use of longitudinal vessel analysis, obtained with pressure  guidewire pullbacks, to better understand how obstructive CAD contributes to  myocardial ischaemia, to establish the likelihood of functionally successful PCI,  to identify the presence and location of residual flow-limiting stenoses and to  predict long-term outcomes. The introduction of new functional coronary  angiography tools, which merge angiographic information with fluid dynamic  equations to deliver information equivalent to intracoronary pressure  measurements, are now available and potentially also applicable to these  endeavours. Furthermore, the ability of longitudinal vessel analysis to predict  the functional results of stenting has played an integral role in the evolving  field of simulated PCI. Nevertheless, it is important to have an awareness of the  value and challenges of physiology-guided PCI in specific clinical and anatomical  contexts. The main aim of this European Association of Percutaneous  Cardiovascular Interventions clinical consensus statement is to offer up-to-date  evidence and expert opinion on the use of applied coronary physiology for  procedural PCI planning, disease pattern recognition and post-PCI optimisation.},

High-resolution and scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that a 5nm thick carbide layer with an average Me:C stoichiometry of 2:1 is formed at this interface. It is shown that the failure of DLC-coated CoCrMo in PBS is due to the instability of Co carbides at the film--implant interface.},

We collect news articles from The New York Times and Reuters, both known for their dedication to provide unbiased news. We then apply each examined LLM to generate news content with headlines of these news articles as prompts, and evaluate the gender and racial biases of the AIGC produced by the LLM by comparing the AIGC and the original news articles. We further analyze the gender bias of each LLM under biased prompts by adding gender-biased messages to prompts constructed from these news headlines. Our study reveals that the AIGC produced by each examined LLM demonstrates substantial gender and racial biases. Moreover, the AIGC generated by each LLM exhibits notable discrimination against females and individuals of the Black race. Among the LLMs, the AIGC generated by ChatGPT demonstrates the lowest level of bias, and ChatGPT is the sole model capable of declining content generation when provided with biased prompts.},

This paper delineates study types, endpoint definitions, follow-up protocols, and analytical approaches, aiming to provide consistency and guidance for interventional cardiologists and trialists.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCB) are emerging as an alternative to permanent implants for managing de novo coronary artery disease, particularly in  small vessels (SVD). This sub-analysis of the PICCOLETO II study aimed to compare  the performance of DCB and DES in terms of Murray's law-based quantitative flow  ratio ({$\mu$}FR) changes between baseline, post-percutaneous coronary intervention  (PCI), and follow-up. METHODS: Patients with a clinical indication for PCI were  assigned to receive either Xience DES or Elutax SV/Emperor DCB. Coronary  angiograms were blindly analyzed by an independent Core Laboratory (Consorzio  Futuro in Ricerca, University of Ferrara, Italy). RESULTS: Among 232 patients, 59  were included in this analysis. Pre-PCI {$\mu$}FR was comparable between groups  (0.65\,{\textpm}\,0.29 vs. 0.58\,{\textpm}\,0.25; p\,=\,0.20). Post-PCI, the DCB group had a lower  acute functional gain compared to DES (+0.21 vs. +0.31; p\,=\,0.064), with lower  {$\mu$}FR values (0.86\,{\textpm}\,0.36 vs. 0.89\,{\textpm}\,0.3; p\,=\,0.074). At 6-month follow-up, {$\mu$}FR  values were similar between groups (0.84\,{\textpm}\,0.29 vs. 0.84\,{\textpm}\,0.31, p\,=\,0.93), with  a comparable late functional loss (-0.02 vs. -0.05; p\,=\,0.93). Angiographic late  lumen loss was significantly lower in the DCB group (-0.03 vs. +0.29\,mm;  p\,=\,0.027). CONCLUSIONS: DCB-based PCI showed a trend toward less favorable  immediate post-PCI functional result but a comparable performance at follow-up,  suggesting its potential in treating de novo SVD.},

Although  these stents reduce rates of restenosis compared with bare metal stents (BMS),  late thrombosis, a life threatening complication, has emerged as a major safety  concern. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of late DES thrombosis is  derived from animal and human pathologic samples taken after implantation of  these devices. These data indicate that both DES cause substantial impairment in  arterial healing characterized by lack of complete reendothelialization and  persistence of fibrin when compared with BMS. This delayed healing is the primary  substrate underlying all cases of late DES thrombosis at autopsy. Several  additional risk factors for late stent thrombosis such as penetration of necrotic  core, malapposition, overlapping stent placement, excessive stent length, and  bifurcation lesions represent additional barriers to healing and should be  avoided if DES are to be used to minimize the risk of late thrombosis. Because  the time course of complete healing with DES in man is unknown, the optimal  duration of antiplatelet treatment remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the relationship between door-to-balloon delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention and ST-elevation myocardial  infarction (MI) outcomes and examine for potential effect modifiers. METHODS: We  conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational  studies that have investigated the relationship of door-to-balloon delay and  clinical outcomes. The main outcomes include mortality and heart failure.  RESULTS: 32 studies involving 299 320 patients contained adequate data for  quantitative reporting. Patients with ST-elevation MI who experienced longer  ({$>$}90\,min) door-to-balloon delay had a higher risk of short-term mortality (pooled  OR 1.52, 95\%\,CI 1.40 to 1.65) and medium-term to long-term mortality (pooled OR  1.53, 95\%\,CI 1.13 to 2.06). A non-linear time-risk relation was observed (P=0.004  for non-linearity). The association between longer door-to-balloon delay and  short-term mortality differed between those presented early and late after  symptom onset (Cochran's Q 3.88, P value 0.049) with a stronger relationship  among those with shorter prehospital delays. CONCLUSION: Longer door-to-balloon  delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-elevation MI is  related to higher risk of adverse outcomes. Prehospital delays modified this  effect. The non-linearity of the time-risk relation might explain the lack of  population effect despite an improved door-to-balloon time in the USA.

However, no clinical benefit has been reported to date. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients (n=627) treated by CABG between 2006 and 2010 were retrospectively included. In 198 patients, at least 1 stenosis was grafted according to FFR (FFR-guided group), whereas in 429 patients all stenoses were grafted based on angiography (angiography-guided group). The 2 coprimary end points were overall death or myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of overall death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization) up to 6-year follow-up. In the FFR-guided group, patients were significantly younger (66 [57-73] versus 70 [63-76]; P{$<$}0.001), more often male (82\% versus 72\%; P=0.008), and less often diabetic (21\% versus 30\%; P=0.023). Clinical follow-up (median, 85 [66-104] months) was analyzed in 396 patients after 1:1 propensity-score matching for these 3 variables. The rate of overall death or myocardial infarction was significantly lower in the FFR-guided (n=31 [16\%] versus n=49 [25\%]; hazard ratio, 0.59 [95\% confidence interval, 0.38-0.93]; P=0.020) as compared with the angiography-guided group. Major adverse cardiovascular events rate was also numerically lower in the FFR-guided than in the angiography-guided group (n=42 [21\%] versus n=52 [26\%]; hazard ratio, 0.77 [95\% confidence interval, 0.51-1.16]; P=0.21).

  abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to assess if intravenous methylnaltrexone can counteract the effects of morphine on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of ticagrelor. Background Morphine delays the onset of action of oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, including ticagrelor, by inhibiting gastric emptying and leading to delayed drug absorption. Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist that has the potential to prevent opioid-induced peripherally mediated side effects (e.g., gastric emptying inhibition) without affecting analgesia. Methods In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, aspirin-treated patients with stable coronary artery disease (n~= 30) were randomized to receive methylnaltrexone (0.3~mg/kg intravenous) or matching placebo. After methylnaltrexone or placebo administration, all patients received morphine (5~mg intravenous). This was followed 15~min later by a 180-mg loading dose of ticagrelor. Patients crossed over to the alternative study treatment after 7 {\textpm} 2~days of washout. PK and PD assessments were performed at 12 time points (6 pre- and 6 post-crossover). PK analysis included measurement of plasma levels of ticagrelor and its major active metabolite (AR-C124910XX). PD assessments included VerifyNow P2Y12, light transmittance aggregometry, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Results Only marginal changes in plasma levels of ticagrelor (and its major active metabolite) were observed with ticagrelor: maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration were 38\% and 30\% higher, respectively, in patients receiving methylnaltrexone compared with those receiving placebo, but no differences in time to maximum plasma concentration were observed. There were no differences in P2Y12 reaction units by VerifyNow P2Y12 between groups at each time point, including 2~h (the primary endpoint; p~= 0.261). Similarly, there were no differences in PD markers assessed by light transmittance aggregometry and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Conclusions In patients with coronary artery disease receiving morphine, intravenous administration of the peripheral opioid receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone leads to only marginal changes in plasma levels of ticagrelor and its major metabolite, without affecting levels of platelet reactivity.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of escalating ticagrelor loading dose (LD) regimens in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). BACKGROUND: Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing PPCI frequently have suboptimal platelet inhibition in the early hours after ticagrelor LD. The use of high ticagrelor LD regimens has been hypothesized to optimize platelet inhibition in PPCI. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized study of escalating ticagrelor LD regimens (180 mg, 270 mg, or 360 mg) in PPCI (N = 52). PK/PD analyses were performed before and 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h post-LD. PK assessments included exposure to ticagrelor and its metabolite (AR-C124910XX). PD assessments included P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) measured by VerifyNow P2Y12 and platelet reactivity index (PRI) measured by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). RESULTS: Platelet reactivity was elevated during the first 2 h post-LD. There were no differences in PRU between groups during the study time course (p = 0.179). There were no significant differences in PRU levels across groups at all time points, except at 1 h (p = 0.017) where platelet reactivity was lowest with a 270-mg LD. No differences were found between the 180-mg and 360-mg groups (primary endpoint; p {$>$} 0.999). High on-treatment platelet reactivity rates were not different across groups, except at 1 hour (p = 0.038). Parallel PD findings were observed with VASP-PRI. PK analysis showed a delay in ticagrelor absorption and generation of AR-C124910XX, irrespective of dose. Although morphine was associated with a delay in ticagrelor PK/PD, it was not an independent predictor of high on-treatment platelet reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing PPCI frequently exhibit impaired response to ticagrelor in the early hours after drug administration, which cannot be overcome by increasing LD regimens. These PD findings are largely attributed to an impaired PK profile, indicating a delay in drug absorption compared with that reported in stable clinical settings.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The platelet inhibitory effects induced by oral P2Y(12) receptor antagonists are delayed in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI). In turn, this leads to a gap in platelet inhibition, exposing patients to an increased risk of early thrombotic complications and underscoring the need to define strategies associated with more effective platelet inhibition in the peri-primary percutaneous coronary intervention period. Cangrelor is an intravenous P2Y(12) inhibitor with prompt and potent antiplatelet effects. However, to date, there are limited data on the effects of cangrelor used in combination with ticagrelor in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Moreover, questions have emerged on the potential for drug-drug interactions during the transition from cangrelor to oral P2Y(12) inhibitors. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic study conducted in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (n=50) who were randomized to treatment with either cangrelor or matching placebo (bolus followed by 2-hour infusion). All patients received ticagrelor 180-mg loading dose administered as crushed tablets at the time of cangrelor/placebo bolus administration. Pharmacodynamic analyses were performed at 8 time points. Pharmacodynamic effects were measured as P2Y(12) reaction units by VerifyNow and platelet reactivity index by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, cangrelor was associated with reduced P2Y(12) reaction units as early as 5 minutes after bolus, which persisted during the entire duration of drug infusion, including at 30 minutes (63 [32-93] versus 214 [183-245]; mean difference, 152 [95\% CI, 108-195]; P{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001; primary end point). Parallel findings were shown with platelet reactivity index. Accordingly, high on-treatment platelet reactivity rates were reduced with cangrelor. After discontinuation of cangrelor/placebo infusion, there were no differences in levels of platelet reactivity between groups, ruling out a drug-drug interaction when cangrelor and ticagrelor are concomitantly administered. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, cangrelor is an effective strategy to bridge the gap in platelet inhibition associated with the use of oral P2Y(12) inhibition induced by ticagrelor. Ticagrelor can be administered as a crushed formulation concomitantly with cangrelor without any apparent drug-drug interaction. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic findings warrant investigation in an adequately powered clinical trial. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Patients were subcategorized into 4 time-to-reperfusion (symptom onset to balloon) quartiles: {$\leq$}90 min (group I, n = 19), {$>$}90 to 150 min (group II, n = 17), {$>$}150 to 360 min (group III, n = 17), and {$>$}360 min (group IV, n = 17). T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery and late gadolinium enhancement CMR were used to characterize reversible and irreversible myocardial injury (area at risk and IS, respectively); salvaged myocardium was defined as the normalized difference between extent of T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery and late gadolinium enhancement. Results Shorter time-to-reperfusion (group I) was associated with smaller IS and microvascular obstruction and larger salvaged myocardium. Mean IS progressively increased overtime: 8\% (group I), 11.7\% (group II), 12.7\% (group III), and 17.9\% (group IV), p = 0.017; similarly, MVO was larger in patients reperfused later (0.5\%, 1.5\%, 3.7\%, and 6.6\%, respectively, p = 0.047). Accordingly, salvaged myocardium markedly decreased when reperfusion occurred {$>$}90 min of coronary occlusion (8.5\%, 3.2\%, 2.4\%, and 2.1\%, respectively, p = 0.004). Conclusions In patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, time to reperfusion determines the extent of reversible and irreversible myocardial injury assessed by CMR. In particular, salvaged myocardium is markedly reduced when reperfusion occurs {$>$}90 min of coronary occlusion.},

Treatment mandates immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore coronary flow and improve hemodynamics and if unsuccessful, urgent implementation of circulatory support, commonly extracorporeal, with subsequent surgical revascularization. We report a case of post-TAVI CO for which successful emergent deployment of Impella percutaneous mechanical circulatory support to restore hemodynamic stability facilitated definitive treatment with bilateral PCI.

  abstract = {Acute occlusion of the left circumflex (LC) artery can be difficult to diagnose. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of LC occlusion in  patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requiring percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI), the frequency of ST-segment versus non-ST-segment elevation  presentation among them, and to correlate the electrocardiographic findings with  the outcomes. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of consecutive patients  from November 2001 through December 2007 with AMI within 7 days before PCI of a  single acutely occluded culprit vessel were included in the present analysis. Of  the 1,500 patients, the culprit lesion was located in the right coronary artery,  left anterior descending artery, or LC artery in 44.7\%, 35.8\%, and 19.5\% of  patients, respectively. Of the 1,500 patients, 72\% presented with ST-segment  elevation AMI, but only 43\% were patients with a LC lesion (n = 127). PCI was  significantly less likely (80\%, 83\%, and 70\% for right coronary, left anterior  descending, and LC artery, respectively; p {$<$} 0.001) to be performed within 24  hours for LC occlusions than for occlusions in the other territories. Among those  with a non-ST-segment elevation AMI, the highest post-PCI troponin levels were in  patients with a LC artery occlusion (median 1.4, 1.3, and 2.5 ng/ml; p {$<$} 0.001).  No significant difference was found in the in-hospital mortality (4.4\%, 7.4\%, and  6.5\%; p = 0.66) or major adverse cardiovascular event (9.2\%, 13.9\%, and 11.6\%; p  = 0.53) rates for right, left anterior descending, and LC occlusions,  respectively. In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that in clinical  practice, the LC artery is the least frequent culprit vessel among patients  treated invasively for AMI. Patients with LC occlusion are less likely to present  with ST-segment elevation AMI and have emergency PCI. The study results suggest  that detection of these patients has been suboptimal, highlighting the need to  improve the diagnostic approach toward the detection of an acutely occluded LC  artery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanistic studies have shown that morphine blunts the antiplatelet effects of oral adenosine diphosphate receptor blockers. However, the clinical relevance of this interaction is controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore the association between morphine and ischemic events in 5,438 patients treated with concomitant clopidogrel presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) in the EARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Patients With Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial. Patients not treated with clopidogrel (n~=~3,462) were used as negative controls. METHODS: Endpoints were the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), recurrent ischemia, or thrombotic bailout at 96 h (4-way endpoint) and the composite of death or MI at 30~days. RESULTS: In patients treated with clopidogrel, morphine use was associated with higher rates of the 4-way endpoint at 96 h (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.87; p~=~0.026). There was a trend for higher rates of death or MI at 30~days (adjusted OR: 1.29; 95\%~CI: 0.98 to 1.70; p~=~0.072), driven by events in the first 48 h (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.54; 95\%~CI: 1.07 to 2.23; p~=~0.021). In patients not treated with clopidogrel, morphine was not associated with either the 4-way endpoint at 96 h (adjusted OR: 1.05; 95\%~CI: 0.74 to 1.49; p~=~0.79; p(interaction)~=~0.36 ) or death or MI at 30~days (adjusted OR: 1.07; 95\%~CI: 0.77 to 1.48; p~=~0.70; p(interaction)~=~0.46). CONCLUSIONS: When used concomitantly with clopidogrel pre-treatment, morphine was associated with higher rates~of ischemic events in patients with NSTEACS.

However, the beneficial effect of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-guided DCB angioplasty in de novo lesions remains uncertain. Objectives This study aimed to assess the benefits of IVUS guidance over angiography guidance during DCB angioplasty in de novo coronary lesions. Methods A total of 260 patients with high bleeding risk who had a de novo coronary lesion (reference vessel diameter 2.0-4.0~mm, and lesion length~{$\leq$}15~mm) were randomly assigned to either an IVUS-guided or an angioplasty-guided DCB angioplasty group. The primary endpoint was in-segment late lumen loss (LLL) at 7~months after procedure. The secondary endpoint was target vessel failure at 6~months. Results A total of 2 patients in the angiography-guided group and 7 patients in the IVUS-guided group underwent bailout stent implantation (P = 0.172). The primary endpoint of 7-month LLL was 0.03 {\textpm} 0.52~mm with angiography guidance vs~-0.10 {\textpm} 0.34~mm with IVUS guidance (mean difference 0.14~mm; 95\%~CI: 0.02-0.26; P~=~0.025). IVUS guidance was also associated with a larger 7-month minimal lumen diameter (2.06 {\textpm} 0.62~mm vs 1.75 {\textpm} 0.63~mm; P~{$<$} 0.001) and a smaller diameter stenosis (28.15\% {\textpm} 13.88\% vs 35.83\% {\textpm} 17.69\%; P~=~0.001) compared with angiography guidance. Five target vessel failures occurred at 6~months, with 4 (3.1\%) in the angiography-guided group and 1 (0.8\%) in the IVUS-guided group (P~=~0.370). Conclusions This study demonstrated that IVUS-guided DCB angioplasty is associated with a lower LLL in patients with a de novo coronary lesion compared with angiography guidance.

METHODS: This retrospective study validated three diagnostic  algorithms (AG) against the presence of a culprit coronary artery upon cardiac  catheterization. Two patient groups were enrolled in this study: those with  verified prehospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation  (cases) and those with a prehospital impression of chest pain due to ACS  (controls). RESULTS: There were 500 records analyzed resulting in a case group  with 151 patients and a control group with 349 patients. Sensitivities differed  between AGs (AG1=0.69 vs AG2=0.68 vs AG3=0.62), with statistical differences in  sensitivity found when comparing AG1 to AG3 and AG1 to AG2. Specificities also  differed between AGs (AG1=0.89 vs AG2=0.91 vs AG3=0.95), with AG1 and AG2  significantly less specific than AG3. CONCLUSIONS: STEMI diagnostic algorithms  vary in regards to their validity in identifying patients with culprit artery  lesions. This suggests that systems could apply more sensitive or specific  algorithms depending on the needs in their community.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement to treat acute coronary syndromes, international clinical guidelines generally recommend dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor for 12 months to prevent myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. However, data on single antiplatelet therapy with a potent P2Y(12) inhibitor earlier than 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with an acute coronary syndrome are scarce. The aim of this trial was to assess whether the use of ticagrelor alone, compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin, could reduce the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding events without an accompanying increase in major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE). METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, patients aged 18 years or older with an acute coronary syndrome who completed the IVUS-ACS study and who had no major ischaemic or bleeding events after 1-month treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy were randomly assigned to receive oral ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) plus oral aspirin (100 mg once daily) or oral ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) plus a matching oral placebo, beginning 1 month and ending at 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention (11 months in total). Recruitment took place at 58 centres in China, Italy, Pakistan, and the UK. Patients were required to remain event-free for 1 month on dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with contemporary drug-eluting stents. Randomisation was done using a web-based system, stratified by acute coronary syndrome type, diabetes, IVUS-ACS randomisation, and site, using dynamic minimisation. The primary superiority endpoint was clinically relevant bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [known as BARC] types 2, 3, or 5). The primary non-inferiority endpoint was MACCE (defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, definite stent thrombosis, or clinically driven target vessel revascularisation), with an expected event rate of 6{$\cdot$}2\% in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group and an absolute non-inferiority margin of 2{$\cdot$}5 percentage points between 1 month and 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. The two co-primary endpoints were tested sequentially; the primary superiority endpoint had to be met for hypothesis testing of the MACCE outcome to proceed. All principal analyses were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03971500, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2019, and Oct 27, 2022, 3400 (97{$\cdot$}0\%) of the 3505 participants in the IVUS-ACS study were randomly assigned (1700 patients to ticagrelor plus aspirin and 1700 patients to ticagrelor plus placebo). 12-month follow-up was completed by 3399 ({$>$}99{$\cdot$}9\%) patients. Between month 1 and month 12 after percutaneous coronary intervention, clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 35 patients (2{$\cdot$}1\%) in the ticagrelor plus placebo group and in 78 patients (4{$\cdot$}6\%) in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}45 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}30 to 0{$\cdot$}66]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). MACCE occurred in 61 patients (3{$\cdot$}6\%) in the ticagrelor plus placebo group and in 63 patients (3{$\cdot$}7\%) in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group (absolute difference -0{$\cdot$}1\% [95\% CI -1{$\cdot$}4\% to 1{$\cdot$}2\%]; HR 0{$\cdot$}98 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}69 to 1{$\cdot$}39]; p(non-inferiority){$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001, p(superiority)=0{$\cdot$}89). INTERPRETATION: In patients with an acute coronary syndrome who had percutaneous coronary intervention with contemporary drug-eluting stents and remained event-free for 1 month on dual antiplatelet therapy, treatment with ticagrelor alone between month 1 and month 12 after the intervention resulted in a lower rate of clinically relevant bleeding and a similar rate of MACCE compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin. Along with the results from previous studies, these findings show that most patients in this population can benefit from superior clinical outcomes with aspirin discontinuation and maintenance on ticagrelor monotherapy after 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy.

We sought to define the distribution of  culprit arteries in these clinical presentations and suggest mechanisms for the  differences. We reviewed 189 coronary angiograms of patients with STEMI, 203 with  NSTEMI, and 548 with stable angina (n=940), and compared distributions of  stenotic and culprit coronary arteries (lesions prompting intervention).  Obstructive coronary lesions ({$\geq$}50\% narrowing) were more prevalent in the left  anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) (36\%-38\%) and similar in the LCx and  right coronary artery (RCA) (27\%-29\%), regardless of clinical presentation (P  {$<$}0.01). In NSTEMI and stable angina, culprit vessels and total obstructive  disease had the same distribution. In STEMI, however, a culprit LCx was  significantly less prevalent (17\%) than was total obstructive disease (27\%; P  {$<$}0.01), or a culprit LAD (47\%) or RCA (34\%) (both P {$<$}0.001). In our computed  tomographic angiographic model of coronary longitudinal strain (percentage of  shortening), LCx strain was only 1.5\% {\textpm} 2.4\%, versus 9.5\% {\textpm} 2.9\% for LAD strain  and 10.1\% {\textpm} 3.9\% for RCA strain. In STEMI, LCx plaques seem less prone to  rupturing. Culprit and total disease distributions are similar in NSTEMI and  angina, suggesting a different ischemic pathophysiology in these presentations.  Lower LCx longitudinal strain might contribute to reduced plaque rupture in  STEMI.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Consensus is lacking regarding the best treatment for coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR). The two most effective treatments are angioplasty with  paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) and repeat stenting with drug-eluting stent (DES)  but individual trials were not statistically powered for clinical endpoints,  results were heterogeneous, and evidence about comparative efficacy and safety in  relevant subsets was limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Difference in  Anti-restenotic Effectiveness of Drug-eluting stent and drug-coated balloon  AngiopLasty for the occUrrence of coronary in-Stent restenosis (DAEDALUS) study  was a comprehensive, investigator-initiated, collaborative, individual patient  data meta-analysis comparing angioplasty with PCB alone vs. repeat stenting with  DES alone for the treatment of coronary ISR. The protocol was registered with  PROSPERO (CRD42017075007). All 10 available randomized clinical trials were  included with 1976 patients enrolled, 1033 assigned to PCB and 943 to DES. At  3-year follow-up, PCB was associated with a significant increase in the risk of  target lesion revascularization (TLR) compared with DES [hazard ratio (HR) 1.32,  95\% CI 1.02--1.70, P\,=\,0.035; number-needed-to-harm 28.5]. There was a significant  interaction between treatment effect and type of restenosed stent (P\,=\,0.029)  with a more marked difference in patients with DES-ISR and comparable effects in  patients with bare-metal stent-ISR. At 3-year follow-up, the primary safety  endpoint of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion thrombosis  was comparable between treatments (HR 0.80, 95\% CI 0.58--1.09, P\,=\,0.152). A  pre-specified subgroup analysis indicated a significant interaction between  treatment effect and type of DES used to treat ISR (P\,=\,0.033), with a lower  incidence of events associated with PCB compared with first-generation DES and  similar effect between PCB and second-generation DES (HR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.71--1.60,  P\,=\,0.764). Long-term all-cause mortality was similar between PCB and DES (HR  0.81, 95\% CI 0.53--1.22, P\,=\,0.310); results were consistent comparing PCB and  non-paclitaxel-based DES (HR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.80--2.54, P\,=\,0.235). Myocardial  infarction and target lesion thrombosis were comparable between treatments.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary ISR, repeat stenting with DES is  moderately more effective than angioplasty with PCB at reducing the need for TLR  at 3\,years. The incidence of a composite of all-cause death, myocardial  infarction, or target lesion thrombosis was similar between groups. The rates of  individual endpoints, including all-cause mortality, were not significantly  different between groups.},

Morphine, on the contrary, is a commonly used drug in the acute phase of acute coronary syndromes to relieve pain-with the added potential benefit of attenuating acutely raised sympathetic tone. In current guidelines, though, morphine is recommended with decreasing strength of recommendation. One reason is that it raises concern regarding the potentially significant interaction with antiplatelet agents, leading to impaired inhibition of platelet activation. In any case, it is still considered a mandatory part of the inventory of available medications in prehospital acute myocardial infarction management. The goal of the present review is to present published evidence on morphine and its potential interactions with P2Y12 receptor antagonists, as well as on the central issue of whether such interactions may underlie clinically significant effects on patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Hepatic hydrothorax can be present in 5\%~to 15\%~of patients with underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, often reflecting advanced liver disease. Its impact can be variable, because patients may have small pleural effusions and minimal pulmonary symptoms or massive pleural effusions and respiratory failure. Management of hepatic hydrothorax can be difficult because these patients often have a number of comorbidities and potential for complications. Minimal high-quality data are available for guidance specifically related to hepatic hydrothorax, potentially resulting in pulmonary or critical care physician struggling for best management options. We therefore provide a Case-based presentation with management options based on currently available data and opinion. We discuss the role of pleural interventions, including thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, indwelling tunneled pleural catheter, pleurodesis, and surgical interventions. In general, we recommend that management be conducted within a multidisciplinary team including pulmonology, hepatology, and transplant surgery. Patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax that are not transplant candidates should be managed with palliative intent; we suggest indwelling tunneled pleural catheter placement unless otherwise contraindicated. For patients with unclear or incomplete hepatology treatment plans or those unable to undergo more definitive procedures, we recommend serial thoracentesis. In patients who are transplant candidates, we often consider serial thoracentesis as a standard treatment, while also evaluating the role indwelling tunneled pleural catheter placement may play within the course of disease and transplant evaluation.},

Areas covered: This paper will analyze the results of the  BiOSS (Bifurcation Optimization Stent System) Clinical Program with a special  focus on the cobalt-chromium BiOSS LIM C stent which has recently been introduced  into the market (CE 2016). The stent is characterized by a strut thickness of  70~{\textmu}m and sirolimus concentration of 1.4~{\textmu}g/mm(2). Expert commentary: The first  BiOSS stent was a bare metal one, but shortly after a paclitaxel-eluting version  was introduced - BiOSS Expert stent (CE 2010). After acceptable results of BiOSS  Expert stent were obtained in registries as well as in the randomized clinical  trial POLBOS I, a way for improvement was to change paclitaxel into the - olimus  drug. Sirolimus has been chosen and the BiOSS LIM stent was developed (CE 2012).  BiOSS LIM is the dedicated bifurcation stent with stainless steel platform that  releases sirolimus (1.4~{\textmu}g/mm(2)) from the surface of a biodegradable coating  comprised of a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids. Nevertheless, the idea to  reduce late lumen loss and as a result TLR rate by using thinner struts appeared.  Therefore, presently first-in-man registry with BiOSS LIM C is ongoing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend potent platelet inhibition with ticagrelor or prasugrel in patients after an acute coronary syndrome. However, data about optimal platelet inhibition in older patients are scarce. We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel compared with ticagrelor or prasugrel in older patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). METHODS: We did the open-label, randomised controlled POPular AGE trial in 12 sites (ten hospitals and two university hospitals) in the Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or older with NSTE-ACS were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using an internet-based randomisation procedure with block sizes of six to receive a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg or 600 mg, or ticagrelor 180 mg or prasugrel 60 mg, and then a maintenance dose for the duration of 12 months (clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, or prasugrel 10 mg once daily) on top of standard care. Patient and treating physicians were aware of the allocated treatment strategy, but the outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Primary bleeding outcome consisted of PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO; major or minor bleeding [superiority hypothesis]). Co-primary net clinical benefit outcome consisted of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, PLATO major and minor bleeding (non-inferiority hypothesis, margin of 2\%). Follow-up duration was 12 months. Analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NL3804), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02317198), and EudraCT (2013-001403-37). FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2013, and Oct 17, 2018, 1002 patients were randomly assigned to clopidogrel (n=500) or ticagrelor or prasugrel (n=502). Because 475 (95\%) patients received ticagrelor in the ticagrelor or prasugrel group, we will refer to this group as the ticagrelor group. Premature discontinuation of the study drug occurred in 238 (47\%) of 502 ticagrelor group patients randomly assigned to ticagrelor, and in 112 (22\%) of 500 patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel. Primary bleeding outcome was significantly lower in the clopidogrel group (88 [18\%] of 500 patients) than in the ticagrelor group (118 [24\%] of 502; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}71, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}54 to 0{$\cdot$}94; p=0{$\cdot$}02 for superiority). Co-primary net clinical benefit outcome was non-inferior for the use of clopidogrel (139 [28\%]) versus ticagrelor (161 [32\%]; absolute risk difference -4\%, 95\% CI -10{$\cdot$}0 to 1{$\cdot$}4; p=0{$\cdot$}03 for non-inferiority). The most important reasons for discontinuation were occurrence of bleeding (n=38), dyspnoea (n=40), and the need for treatment with oral anticoagulation (n=35). INTERPRETATION: In patients aged 70 years or older presenting with NSTE-ACS, clopidogrel is a favourable alternative to ticagrelor, because it leads to fewer bleeding events without an increase in the combined endpoint of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding. Clopidogrel could be an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor especially for elderly patients with a higher bleeding risk. FUNDING: ZonMw.},

In an effort to improve their accuracy and reduce the risk of misdiagnoses, we applied methods from the field of collective intelligence to produce synthetic differential diagnoses that aggregate answers from individual commercial LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, Cohere Command, and Meta Llama 2). Using 200 clinical vignettes of real-life cases from the Human Diagnosis Project platform, we assessed and compared the accuracy of differential diagnoses from individual LLMs with those from aggregated LLM responses. We aggregated the LLM responses into synthetic differential diagnoses using a simple frequency-based, 1/r-weighted method, in which more weight is given to diagnoses appearing near the top of the LLM responses and appearing in the responses of multiple LLMs. We evaluated all possible combinations of LLMs by calculating various TOP-n accuracy metrics: that is, how frequently the correct diagnosis matches any of the first n diagnoses. We found that aggregating responses from multiple LLMs leads to more accurate differential diagnoses (average TOP-5 accuracy for three LLMs: 75.3\%{\textpm}1.6 percentage points) compared with the differential diagnoses produced by single LLMs (average TOP-5 accuracy for single LLMs: 59.0\%{\textpm}6.1 percentage points). We also found that aggregating smaller and less capable models (TOP-5 accuracy for three smaller LLMs, not including GPT-4: 70.0\%) can rival the accuracy of the top-performing model (TOP-5 accuracy for GPT-4: 72.0\%). The use of collective intelligence methods to synthesize differential diagnoses, combining the responses of different LLMs, achieves three of the necessary steps toward advancing LLMs as a diagnostic support tool: demonstrating sufficiently high diagnostic accuracy, reducing the risk of misdiagnoses, and eliminating the dependence on a single commercial vendor. (Funded by the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program.) This study has tested the synthesis of high-accuracy differential diagnoses by aggregating responses from multiple heterogeneous large language models using methods for knowledge aggregation from the field of collective intelligence.}

  abstract = {AIMS: Visual estimation is the most commonly used method to evaluate the degree of coronary artery stenosis prior to coronary artery bypass grafting. In interventional cardiology, the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide revascularization decisions has become routine. We investigated whether the preoperative FFR measurement of coronary lesions is associated with anastomosis function 6 months after surgical revascularization using a multiarterial grafting strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective double-blind study, 67 patients were enrolled from two institutions in Europe and Canada. From these patients, 199 coronary lesions were assessed visually and with FFR at the time of the preoperative angiogram. All patients received coronary revascularization using multiple arterial grafts. A post-operative 6-month angiogram was performed to assess anastomosis functionality using a described angiographic method. The primary outcome was the association between preoperative FFR values and anastomosis function 6 months after surgery. Preoperative FFR was significantly associated with 6-months anastomotic function for all conduits and for all targets (P\, {$<$} \,0.001). An FFR value of {$\leq$}0.78 was associated with an anastomotic occlusion rate of 3\%. CONCLUSION: We found a significant association between the preoperative FFR measurement of the target vessel and the anastomotic functionality at 6 months, with a cut-off of 0.78. Integration of FFR measurement into the preoperative diagnostic workup before multiarterial coronary surgical revascularization leads to improved anastomotic graft function. CLINICAL TRIALS.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shorter time to reperfusion is associated with a significant reduction in mortality; however, its association with heart failure (HF) is not  clearly documented. We conducted a systematic review to examine the association  between time to reperfusion and incident HF and/or left ventricular dysfunction.  METHODS: MEDLINE/OVID, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases  were searched from January 1974 to May 2012 for studies that reported the  association between time to reperfusion and incident HF or left ventricular  ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary  intervention. RESULTS: Of 362 nonduplicate abstracts, 71 studies were selected  for full-text review. Thirty-three studies were included in the final review, of  which 16 were single-center studies, 7 were population-based studies, 7 were  subanalyses from randomized controlled trials, and 3 were based on national  samples. The pooled data demonstrate that every 1-hour delay in time to  reperfusion is associated with a 4\% to 12\% increased risk of new-onset HF and a  4\% relative increase in the risk of incident HF during follow-up. Early  reperfusion was associated with a 2\% to 8\% greater LVEF before discharge and a 3\%  to 12\% larger improvement in absolute LVEF at follow-up compared with the index  admission. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review presents evidence that longer time  to reperfusion is not only associated with worsened left ventricular systolic  function and new-onset HF at the time of index admission, but also with increased  risk of HF and reduced improvement in left ventricular systolic function during  follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this secondary analysis of the PACIFY randomized trial, we assessed whether dose and timing of fentanyl have implications for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ticagrelor loading during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: Among 212 patients undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography, a total of 70 required PCI and received 180 mg oral ticagrelor. Of these, thirty-two patients received no fentanyl and 38 received fentanyl (with variability in the timing of administration and cumulative dose among those randomized to fentanyl, given that both were provided at the interventional cardiologist's discretion). A time-weighted cumulative fentanyl exposure variable was calculated based on total dose of fentanyl and proximity in time of fentanyl administrations to the ticagrelor load. Patients were stratified based on receiving above or below the median time-weighted cumulative dose. Outcomes included ticagrelor concentrations by mass spectrometry (24-hour area under the curve) and platelet function measured using both VerifyNow platelet reactivity units (PRU) and light-transmission aggregometry (LTA). RESULTS: Unadjusted ticagrelor 24-hour area under the curve was significantly lower across the categories of increasing fentanyl exposure (P=.02). In adjusted regression models, this difference only remained when comparing the no-fentanyl group with the time-weighted cumulative dose above the median group (P=.04). Similarly, with the no-fentanyl group as the reference, adjusted models testing 2-hour PRU and LTA values demonstrated significant differences (with less platelet inhibition for both tests) only among those with time-weighted cumulative fentanyl exposures above the median value (5.1 mug/min). CONCLUSIONS: We have previously shown that fentanyl slows absorption of oral ticagrelor, attenuating its effect on platelet inhibition. We now demonstrate this mechanism appears to be dose- and time-dependent.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biliary reconstruction represents one of the most challenging parts of right lobe (RL) living donor liver transplantations (LDLTs). Different causes, surgical techniques, and treatments have been suggested but are incompletely defined. METHODS: Between June 1999 and January 2002, 96 RL LDLTs were performed in our center. We reviewed the incidence of biliary complications in all the recipients. RESULTS: Roux-en-Y reconstruction was performed in 53 cases (55.2\%) and duct-to-duct was performed in 39 cases (40.6\%). Both procedures were performed in 4 cases (4.2\%). Multiple ducts ({$>$} or =2) were found in 58 grafts (60.4\%). Thirty-nine recipients (40.6\%) had 43 biliary complications: 21 had bile leaks, 22 had biliary strictures, and 4 had both complications. Patients with multiple ducts had a higher incidence of bile leaks than those patients with a single duct (P=0.049). No significant differences in complications were found between Roux-en-Y or duct-to-duct reconstructions. Freedom from biliary complications was 59\% at 1 year and 55\% at 2 years. The overall 1-year and 2-year survival rates for patients were 86\% and 81\%, respectively. The overall 1-year and 2-year survival rates for grafts were 80\% and 77\%, respectively. Occurrence of bile leaks affected patient and graft survival (76\% and 65\% 2-year patient and graft survival, respectively, vs. 89\% and 85\% for those without biliary leaks, P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Despite technical modifications and application of various surgical techniques, biliary complications remain frequent after RL LDLT. Patients with multiple biliary reconstructions had a higher incidence of bile leaks. Patients who developed leaks had lower patient and graft survival rates.},

In multi-state models comparing transition probabilities of events, sex was not associated with increased risk of any event. For each year increase in age, the increased risk of non-CVD and CVD mortality was 8\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 6--9\%]. Being migrant was associated with a lower risk of non-CVD mortality [hazard ratio (HR) (95\% CI) 0.49 (0.27--0.90)] but not with CVD mortality. In logistic regression analysis, CR uptake was lower among women [odds ratio (95\% CI)\,=\,0.72 (0.57--0.86)] and older adults [0.32 (0.27--0.38)], but not among migrants. In cox regression, CR was independently associated with lower all-cause [HR (95\% CI)\,=\,0.12 (0.03--0.37)] and CVD mortality [0.1 (0.02--0.7)], but not with MACE [1.08 (0.8--1.4)].Among underrepresented groups undergoing PCI, age, but not migration status nor sex, contributed to disparities in mortality. Migrant status did not result in lower attendance of CR. Considering the protective associations of CR on CVD mortality independent of age, sex, and migration status, the lower uptake in women and older adults is noteworthy.}

  abstract = {AIMS: The delay in seeking timely medical care by patients with acute coronary syndrome and stroke is well established. Less is known about the delay in  patients with heart failure (HF). Reducing the delay in seeking care and the  early initiation of treatment is associated with improved outcomes in patients  with HF. The purpose of this narrative review was to describe the length of the  delay in seeking care for HF symptoms and identify symptom-related factors that  contribute to the delay in seeking medical care. METHODS AND RESULTS: A  literature search was conducted to identify English language studies that (i)  describe the length of care-seeking delay for HF symptoms and/or (ii) identify  symptom-related factors that contribute to delay in seeking medical care. The  results of this review demonstrate that upon hospital admission patients report  wide variations in median symptom time course from 2 h to 7 days from the onset  of symptoms to hospital admission. The ability of patients to recognize,  interpret, and appraise HF symptoms has been demonstrated to be limited. Symptom  characteristics such as dyspnoea, oedema, orthopnoea, higher somatic awareness,  higher symptom distress, nocturnal symptom onset, and the pattern of symptom  onset were related to longer delay in care-seeking for HF symptoms. Furthermore,  cognitive responses to HF may also play an important role in symptom appraisal.  CONCLUSION: Delays in seeking care for HF symptoms have been shown to range from  hours to days from symptom onset to hospital admission. Healthcare professionals  should therefore be more vigilant in identifying high-risk individuals and  educating them about the warning signs of HF. Moreover, access to outpatient  chronic disease management programmes may have the potential to reduce these  delays.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is a widely adopted strategy for the treatment of de novo  coronary artery disease. DES implantation conveys an inherent risk for short- and  long-term complications, including in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis.  Drug-coated balloons are emerging as an alternative approach to fulfill the  "leaving nothing behind" principle and avoid long-term DES-related complications.  DESIGN: TRANSFORM II is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, noninferiority,  randomized clinical trial, testing a sirolimus-coated balloon (SCB) versus the  standard of care for native coronary vessels with a 2-3\,mm diameter, in terms of  12-month target lesion failure (TLF; primary endpoint) and net adverse  cardiovascular events (coprimary endpoint). Patients undergoing PCI will be  randomized to be treated with either SCB or new-generation everolimus-eluting  stent and will be followed up clinically for up to 60 months. Assuming a TLF rate  of 8\% at 12 months with DES, a sample size of 1325 patients was chosen to ensure  an 80\% power to detect a 1.5\% lower incidence in the SCB group with a type I  error rate of 0.05. The TRANSFORM II trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov  (identification number NCT04893291). Several substudies, including an optical  coherence tomography assessment at 9 months (intracoronary imaging substudy),  will investigate the study device in different clinical and lesion settings.  CONCLUSIONS: The randomized TRANSFORM II trial will determine whether a novel SCB  is noninferior to a current everolimus-eluting stent when adopted for the  treatment of de novo lesions in coronary vessels with a diameter between 2 and  3\,mm.},

However, the precise physiological and biochemical  mechanisms that underlie such relationships are not well understood. This review  focuses on the neurobiological processes and mediators that are common to both  mood and cardiovascular disorders. The discussion places an emphasis on the role  of exogenous stressors in addition to: (a) neuroendocrine and neurohumoral  changes involving dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the  activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, (b) immune alterations  including activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (c) autonomic and  cardiovascular dysregulation including increased sympathetic drive, withdrawal of  parasympathetic tone, cardiac rate and rhythm disturbances, and altered  baroreceptor reflex function, (d) central neurotransmitter system dysfunction  involving the dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin systems, and (e) behavioral  changes including fatigue and physical inactivity. The review also discusses  experimental investigations using preclinical disease models to elucidate the  neurobiological mechanisms underlying the link between mood disorders and  cardiovascular disease. These include: (a) the chronic mild stress model of  depression, (b) a model of congestive heart failure, (c) a model of  cardiovascular deconditioning, (d) pharmacological manipulations of body fluid  and sodium balance, and (e) pharmacological manipulations of the central  serotonergic system. In combination with an extensive human research literature,  the investigation of mechanisms underlying mood and cardiovascular regulation  using animal models will enhance understanding the association between depression  and cardiovascular disease. This will ultimately promote the development of  better treatments and interventions for individuals with co-morbid psychological  and somatic pathologies.},

Improved performance in natural language processing tasks, such as text and speech processing, have fueled impressive demonstrations of these models' capabilities. Perhaps no demonstration has been more impactful to date than the introduction of the publicly available online chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, which is based on a natural language processing model known as a Generative Pretrained Transformer. Through a series of questions posed by the authors about obstetrics and gynecology to ChatGPT as prompts, we evaluated the model's ability to handle clinical-related queries. Its answers demonstrated that in its current form, ChatGPT can be valuable for users who want preliminary information about virtually any topic in the field. Because its educational role is still being defined, we must recognize its limitations. Although answers were generally eloquent, informed, and lacked a significant degree of mistakes or misinformation, we also observed evidence of its weaknesses. A significant drawback is that the data on which the model has been trained are apparently not readily updated. The specific model that was assessed here, seems to not reliably (if at all) source data from after 2021. Users of ChatGPT who expect data to be more up to date need to be aware of this drawback. An inability to cite sources or to truly understand what the user is asking suggests that it has the capability to mislead. Responsible use of models like ChatGPT will be important for ensuring that they work to help but not harm users seeking information on obstetrics and gynecology.},

Coating of stents is a possible approach to prevent this  side effect. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro the  biocompatibility of stents coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC).  Semiquantitative energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyses showed a complete coverage  of the DLC stents. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a significantly higher  increase of mean channel fluorescence intensity for the activation-dependent  antigens CD62p and CD63 in non-coated compared to DLC-coated stents (p{$<$}0.05).  Atomic adsorption spectrophotometry analyses revealed a significant release of  nickel and chromium metal ions by non-coated stents over a storage period of 96  hours in human plasma (p{$<$}0.05). In contrast, only minimal concentrations of  released ions could be detected in the case of DLC-coated stents. Similar  observations were made with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  analyses. Here, high concentrations of molybdenum and manganese ions were  released from non-coated stents (p{$<$}0.05), while release of these ions from  DLC-coated stents was virtually undetectable (p=0.1 for molybdenum and p=0.4 for  manganese). Coating of intracoronary stents with diamond-like carbon  significantly improves biocompatibility. This biocompatible coating may therefore  contribute to a reduction in thrombogenicity.},

An 82-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis, hypertension complicated with chronic renal failure while on hemodialysis, presented with progressive dyspnea in association with a recurrent right-sided pleural effusion, occurring secondary to transdiaphragmatic migration of ascites. The diagnosis was established by a demonstration of (99m)Tc-sulphur colloid sequential scintigraphic scan. Despite repetitive thoracenteses and traditional medical treatment, she suffered dyspnea without relief. Denver peritoneovenous shunt was inserted into the right-sided pleural cavity to drain effusion into the subclavian vein without short- and long-term complications. Manually pumping schedule of 10 min was performed twice daily to remove pleural fluid into the venous circulation for maintaining shunt patency. After 19 months of follow-up, the patient is doing well and PVS remains patent without significant pleural effusion. PVS opens a window of opportunity and offers an alternative procedure with minimal invasiveness for high-risk patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax. It could be an alternative treatment to other conventional surgical interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate ChatGPT's performance in brain glioma adjuvant therapy decision-making. METHODS: We randomly selected 10 patients with brain gliomas discussed at our institution's central nervous system tumour board (CNS TB). Patients' clinical status, surgical outcome, textual imaging information and immuno-pathology results were provided to ChatGPT V.3.5 and seven CNS tumour experts. The chatbot was asked to give the adjuvant treatment choice, and the regimen while considering the patient's functional status. The experts rated the artificial intelligence-based recommendations from 0 (complete disagreement) to 10 (complete agreement). An intraclass correlation coefficient agreement (ICC) was used to measure the inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: Eight patients (80\%) met the criteria for glioblastoma and two (20\%) were low-grade gliomas. The experts rated the quality of ChatGPT recommendations as poor for diagnosis (median 3, IQR 1-7.8, ICC 0.9, 95\%\,CI 0.7 to 1.0), good for treatment recommendation (7, IQR 6-8, ICC 0.8, 95\%\,CI 0.4 to 0.9), good for therapy regimen (7, IQR 4-8, ICC 0.8, 95\%\,CI 0.5 to 0.9), moderate for functional status consideration (6, IQR 1-7, ICC 0.7, 95\%\,CI 0.3 to 0.9) and moderate for overall agreement with the recommendations (5, IQR 3-7, ICC 0.7, 95\%\,CI 0.3 to 0.9). No differences were observed between the glioblastomas and low-grade glioma ratings. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT performed poorly in classifying glioma types but was good for adjuvant treatment recommendations as evaluated by CNS TB experts. Even though the ChatGPT lacks the precision to replace expert opinion, it may serve as a promising supplemental tool within a human-in-the-loop approach.},

  abstract = {Background/Aims: The management of hepatic hydrothorax (HH) remains a challenging clinical scenario with suboptimal options. We investigated the effect and safety of pigtail catheter drainage compared to intermittent thoracentesis. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective study included 164 cirrhotic patients with recurrent pleural effusion from March 2012 to June 2017. Patients with neoplasms, cardiopulmonary disease, and infectious conditions were excluded. We compared the clinical outcomes of pigtail catheter drainage versus thoracentesis for variables including complications related to procedures, overall survival, and re-admission rates. Results: A total of 164 patients were divided into pigtail catheter (n = 115) and thoracentesis (n = 49) groups. During the follow-up period of 6.93 months after discharge, 98 patients died (pigtail; n = 47 vs. thoracentesis; n = 51). The overall survival (p = 0.61) and 30-day mortality (p = 0.77) rates were similar between the pigtail catheter and thoracentesis groups. Only MELD scores were associated with overall survival (adjusted HR, 1.08; p {$<$} 0.01) in patients with HH. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 59 patients (51.3\%) in the pigtail catheter group. Re-admission rates did not differ between the pigtail catheter and thoracentesis groups (13.2\% vs 19.6\% p = 0.7). A total of five complications occurred, including four total cases of bleeding (one patient in the pigtail catheter group and three in the thoracentesis group) and one case of empyema in the pigtail catheter group. Conclusions: Pigtail catheter drainage is not inferior to that of intermittent thoracentesis for the management of HH, proving it may be an effective and safe clinical option.},

Multidisciplinary decision-making has gained more emphasis over the recent years to select the most optimal treatment strategy for individual patients with stable complex coronary artery disease. However, the so-called 'Heart Team' concept has not been widely implemented. Yet, decision-making has shown to remain suboptimal; there is large variability in PCI-to-CABG ratios, which may predominantly be the consequence of physician-related factors that have raised concerns regarding overuse, underuse, and inappropriate selection of revascularization. In this review, we summarize these and additional data to support the statement that a multidisciplinary Heart Team consisting of at least a clinical/non-invasive cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, and cardiac surgeon, can together better analyse and interpret the available diagnostic evidence, put into context the clinical condition of the patient as well as consider individual preference and local expertise, and through shared decision-making with the patient can arrive at a most optimal joint treatment strategy recommendation for patients with stable complex coronary artery disease. In addition, other aspects of Heart Team decision-making are discussed: the organization and logistics, involvement of physicians, patients, and assisting personnel, the need for validation, and its limitations.},

  abstract = {Background--- Myocarditis can occasionally lead to sudden death and may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy in up to 10\% of patients. Because the initial onset is difficult to recognize clinically and the diagnostic tools available are unsatisfactory, new strategies to diagnose myocarditis are needed. Methods and Results--- Cardiovascular MR imaging (CMR) was performed in 32 patients who were diagnosed with myocarditis by clinical criteria. To determine whether CMR visualizes areas of active myocarditis, endomyocardial biopsy was taken from the region of contrast enhancement and submitted to histopathologic analysis. Follow-up was performed 3 month later. Contrast enhancement was present in 28 patients (88\%) and was usually seen with one or several foci in the myocardium. Foci were most frequently located in the lateral free wall. In the 21 patients in whom biopsy was obtained from the region of contrast enhancement, histopathologic analysis revealed active myocarditis in 19 patients (parvovirus B19, n=12; human herpes virus type 6 [HHV 6], n=5). Conversely, in the remaining 11 patients, in whom biopsy could not be taken from the region of contrast enhancement, active myocarditis was found in one case only (HHV6). At follow-up, the area of contrast enhancement decreased from 9{\textpm}11\% to 3{\textpm}4\% of left ventricular mass as the left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 47{\textpm}19\% to 60{\textpm}10\%. Conclusions--- Contrast enhancement is a frequent finding in the clinical setting of suspected myocarditis and is associated with active inflammation defined by histopathology. Myocarditis occurs predominantly in the lateral free wall. Contrast CMR is a valuable tool for the evaluation and monitoring of inflammatory heart disease.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients who suffer from acute chest pain are transported by ambulance. It is not known how often treatment prior to hospital admission is optimal and how optimal pain-relieving treatment is defined. It is often difficult to delineate pain from anxiety. AIM: To describe various aspects of chest pain in the pre-hospital setting with the emphasis on a) treatment and b) presumed acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In the literature search, we used PubMed and the appropriate key words. We included randomised clinical trials and observational studies. RESULTS: Four types of drug appear to be preferred: 1) narcotic analgesics, 2) nitrates, 3) beta-blockers and 4) benzodiazepines. Among narcotic analgesics, morphine has been associated with the relief of pain at the expense of side-effects. Alfentanil was reported to produce more rapid pain relief. Nitrates have been associated with the relief of pain with few side-effects. Beta-blockers have been reported to increase the relief of pain when added to morphine. The combination of beta-blockers and morphine has been reported to be as effective as beta-blockers alone in pain relief, but this combination therapy was associated with more side-effects. Experience from anxiety-relieving drugs such as benzodiazepines is limited. It is not known how these 4 drugs should be combined. The results indicate that various pain-relieving treatments might modify the disease. CONCLUSION: Our knowledge of the optimal treatment of chest pain and associated anxiety in the pre-hospital setting is insufficient. Recommendations from existing guidelines are limited. Large randomised clinical trials are warranted.},

In 200 patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for de novo lesions, FFR was measured after POBA (POBA--FFR). If POBA--FFR was {$\geq$}\,0.75, patients were treated with PCB (PCB group, n\,=\,78) or stent (Stent group, n\,=\,73). If POBA--FFR was {$<$}\,0.75, stent was implanted as planned (Reference group, n\,=\,42). The primary endpoint was late lumen loss at 9~months and the secondary endpoint was adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion thrombosis, or repeat revascularization) at 12~months follow-up. There was no between-group differences in the POBA--FFR (0.87\,{\textpm}\,0.05 in PCB, 0.89\,{\textpm}\,0.06 in stent, p\,=\,0.101). At 9~months, late lumen loss was significantly lower in the PCB group compared to the Stent group (0.05\,{\textpm}\,0.33 vs. 0.59\,{\textpm}\,0.76~mm, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Adverse cardiac events were not different between the PCB, Stent and Reference groups (2.6, 5.5, and 9.5\% respectively; p\,=\,0.430 for PCB vs. Stent group; p\,=\,0.229 for the reference vs. both other groups). PCB treatment guided by POBA--FFR showed excellent 9~months angiographic and functional results, as well as comparable 12~months clinical outcomes, compared with stent implantation for de novo coronary lesions.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and years of life lost worldwide. While effective treatments are available for both acute  and chronic disease stages there are unmet needs for effective interventions to  support patients in health behaviors required for secondary prevention.  Psychosocial distress is a common comorbidity in patients with CHD and associated  with substantially reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), poor health  behavior, and low treatment adherence. METHODS: In a confirmatory, randomized,  controlled, two-arm parallel group, multicenter behavioral intervention trial we  will randomize 440 distressed CHD patients with at least one insufficiently  controlled cardiac risk factor to either their physicians' usual care (UC) or UC  plus 12-months of blended collaborative care (TeamCare\,=\,TC). Trained nurse care  managers (NCM) will proactively support patients to identify individual sources  of distress and risk behaviors, establish a stepwise treatment plan to improve  self-help and healthy behavior, and actively monitor adherence and progress.  Additional e-health resources are available to patients and their families.  Intervention fidelity is ensured by a treatment manual, an electronic patient  registry, and a specialist team regularly supervising NCM via videoconferences  and recommending protocol and guideline-compliant treatment adjustments as  indicated. Recommendations will be shared with patients and their physicians who  remain in charge of patients' care. Since HRQoL is a recommended outcome by both,  several guidelines and patient preference we chose a\,{$\geq$}\,50\% improvement over  baseline on the HeartQoL questionnaire at 12~months as primary outcome. Our  primary hypothesis is that significantly more patients receiving TC will meet the  primary outcome criterion compared to the UC group. Secondary hypotheses will  evaluate improvements in risk factors, psychosocial variables, health care  utilization, and durability of intervention effects over 18-30~months of  follow-up. DISCUSSION: TEACH is the first study of a blended collaborative care  intervention simultaneously addressing distress and medical CHD risk factors  conducted in cardiac patients in a European health care setting. If proven  effective, its results can improve long-term chronic care of this vulnerable  patient group and may be adapted for patients with other chronic conditions.

The purpose of this study is to describe the outcomes of patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in TAVI. Among 384 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI from April 2010 to July 2017 in Sakakibara Heart Institute, we evaluated seven patients (1.8\%) who required ECMO during procedure. The definitions of outcome were derived from Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The indication of ECMO included bridge to emergent surgery due to mechanical complication (n\,=\,3) [aortic root rupture (n\,=\,2), and left-ventricle rupture (n\,=\,1); emergent use], bridge to recovery from cardiac stunning (n\,=\,3; emergent use), and circulatory support for cardiogenic shock (n\,=\,1; prophylactic use). All patients were cannulated from femoral artery and vein, and there was no ECMO-related complication. Six out of seven patients were weaned from ECMO during the TAVI procedure, whereas the other patient with annulus rupture died the following day after TAVI. Five patients survived to discharge [postoperative hospital stay: 27.6\,{\textpm}\,24.3 (23) days]. During mean follow-up of 253~days, a total of three patients died due to annulus rupture, refractory heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively. ECMO is effective and a safe mechanical support device during TAVI. The mid-term outcomes of patients who needed ECMO were unfavorable. Further evolution of transcatheter heart valve is essential, and prophylactic ECMO may contribute to better prognosis in selected patients.},

Patients were free of cardiovascular disease and not prescribed statins at baseline.Methods~Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years. Risk factors considered included those already in QRISK2 (age, ethnicity, deprivation, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol: high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, smoking, family history of coronary heart disease in a first degree relative aged less than 60 years, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, treated hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease (stage 4 or 5)) and new risk factors (chronic kidney disease (stage 3, 4, or 5), a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and HIV/AIDs). We also considered erectile dysfunction diagnosis or treatment in men. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status.Main outcome measures~Incident cardiovascular disease recorded on any of the following three linked data sources: general practice, mortality, or hospital admission records.Results~363\,565 incident cases of cardiovascular disease were identified in the derivation cohort during follow-up arising from 50.8 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met the model inclusion criteria except for HIV/AIDS, which was not statistically significant. The models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the algorithm explained 59.6\% of the variation in time to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (R2, with higher values indicating more variation), and the D statistic was 2.48 and Harrell's C statistic was 0.88 (both measures of discrimination, with higher values indicating better discrimination). The corresponding values for men were 54.8\%, 2.26, and 0.86. Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was similar to the QRISK2 algorithms.Conclusion~Updated QRISK3 risk prediction models were developed and validated. The inclusion of additional clinical variables in QRISK3 (chronic kidney disease, a measure of systolic blood pressure variability (standard deviation of repeated measures), migraine, corticosteroids, SLE, atypical antipsychotics, severe mental illness, and erectile dysfunction) can help enable doctors to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke.}

The aim was to evaluate if the morphine dose impacts ticagrelor effect in STEMI patients presenting for percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods: The patient cohort was divided into quartiles based on morphine dose (mg/kg). Platelet inhibition was measured with vasodilator-associated stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) platelet reactivity index (PRI) and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) was defined as {$\geq$}50\% PRI. Blood samples for analyses of VASP PRI and plasma concentrations of morphine, ticagrelor, and AR-C124910XX were taken at baseline (arrival in the catherization lab) and one and 2 h later. The primary endpoint was PRI difference between the highest morphine dose quartile compared with the lowest morphine dose quartile 2 h after study inclusion. Results: A total of 80 STEMI patients treated with morphine and ticagrelor were included in the study. The time from ticagrelor administration to randomization did not differ significantly between the different morphine dose quartiles, with an overall median of 44 min (interquartile range, IQR: 35--57 min). The primary outcome variable PRI at 2 h after study inclusion was significantly higher in patients in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 (61.7\% [42.4--91.2] vs. 26.6\% [9.17--73.6], p = 0.024). Ticagrelor concentrations were significantly lower in both quartile 3 and 4 compared with quartile 1 at all the three timepoints. Conclusion: STEMI patients with higher weight-based morphine doses had significantly lower uptake and anti\- platelet effect after a 180 mg loading dose ticagrelor.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the peripheral opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone could improve pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of orally administered ticagrelor in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction receiving morphine. Methods and Results The MOVEMENT (Methylnaltrexone to Improve Platelet Inhibition of Ticagrelor in Morphine-Treated Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction treated with morphine and ticagrelor. Upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory, patients were randomized to a blinded intravenous injection of either methylnaltrexone (8 or 12 mg according to weight) or 0.9\% sodium chloride. The proportion of patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity and plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR -C124910XX were assessed at baseline (arrival in the catheterization laboratory) and 1 and 2 hours later. A total of 82 patients received either methylnaltrexone (n=43) or placebo (n=39). Median (interquartile range) time from ticagrelor administration to randomization was 41 (31-50) versus 45.5 (37-60) minutes ( P=0.16). Intravenous methylnaltrexone administration did not significantly affect prevalence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity at 2 hours after inclusion, the primary end point, when compared with placebo (54\% versus 51\%, P=0.84). Plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite, the prespecified secondary end points, did not differ significantly between the groups over time. There was no significant difference in patient self-estimated pain between the groups. Conclusions Methylnaltrexone did not significantly improve platelet reactivity or plasma concentrations of orally administered ticagrelor in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction receiving morphine.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with better clinical outcomes than angiography-guided PCI. Whether routine optical coherence tomography (OCT) guidance in PCI of lesions involving coronary-artery branch points (bifurcations) improves clinical outcomes as compared with angiographic guidance is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial at 38 centers in Europe. Patients with a clinical indication for PCI and a complex bifurcation lesion identified by means of coronary angiography were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to OCT-guided PCI or angiography-guided PCI. The primary end point was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death from a cardiac cause, target-lesion myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target-lesion revascularization at a median follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS: We assigned 1201 patients to OCT-guided PCI (600 patients) or angiography-guided PCI (601 patients). A total of 111 patients (18.5\%) in the OCT-guided PCI group and 116 (19.3\%) in the angiography-guided PCI group had a bifurcation lesion involving the left main coronary artery. At 2 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 59 patients (10.1\%) in the OCT-guided PCI group and in 83 patients (14.1\%) in the angiography-guided PCI group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95\% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.98; P\,=\,0.035). Procedure-related complications occurred in 41 patients (6.8\%) in the OCT-guided PCI group and 34 patients (5.7\%) in the angiography-guided PCI group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with complex coronary-artery bifurcation lesions, OCT-guided PCI was associated with a lower incidence of MACE at 2 years than angiography-guided PCI.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stopping aspirin within 1 month after implantation of a drug-eluting stent for ticagrelor monotherapy has not been exclusively evaluated for patients with acute coronary syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ticagrelor monotherapy after {$<$}1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is noninferior to 12 months of ticagrelor-based DAPT for adverse cardiovascular and bleeding events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial, 2850 patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent drug-eluting stent implantation at 24 centers in South Korea were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice daily) after {$<$}1 month of DAPT (n=1426) or 12 months of ticagrelor-based DAPT (n=1424) between April 24, 2019, and May 31, 2022. The primary end point was the net clinical benefit as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, stroke, and major bleeding at 1 year after the index procedure in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary end points were the individual components of the primary end point. RESULTS: Among 2850 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61 years; 40\% ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction), 2823 (99.0\%) completed the trial. Aspirin was discontinued at a median of 16 days (interquartile range, 12-25 days) in the group receiving ticagrelor monotherapy after {$<$}1 month of DAPT. The primary end point occurred in 40 patients (2.8\%) in the group receiving ticagrelor monotherapy after {$<$}1-month DAPT, and in 73 patients (5.2\%) in the ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT group (hazard ratio, 0.54 [95\% CI, 0.37-0.80]; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.002 for superiority). This finding was consistent in the per-protocol population as a sensitivity analysis. The occurrence of major bleeding was significantly lower in the ticagrelor monotherapy after {$<$}1-month DAPT group compared with the 12-month DAPT group (1.2\% versus 3.4\%; hazard ratio, 0.35 [95\% CI, 0.20-0.61]; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that stopping aspirin within 1 month for ticagrelor monotherapy is both noninferior and superior to 12-month DAPT for the 1-year composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, and major bleeding, primarily because of a significant reduction in major bleeding, among patients with acute coronary syndrome receiving drug-eluting stent implantation. Low event rates, which may suggest enrollment of relatively non-high-risk patients, should be considered in interpreting the trial.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is a serious complication of end-stage liver diseases, which is associated with poor survival. There is no consensus regarding the treatment of HH. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pleurodesis for HH in a systematic review with meta-analysis. METHODS: All relevant papers were searched on the EMBASE and PubMed databases. As for the data from the eligible case reports, the continuous data were expressed as the median (range) and the categorical data were expressed as the frequency (percentage). As for the data from the eligible case series, the rates of complete response and complications were pooled. The proportions with 95~\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using random-effect model. RESULTS: Twenty case reports including 26 patients and 13 case series including 180 patients were eligible. As for the case reports, the median age was 55~years (range 7-78) and 15 patients were male. The prevalence of ascites was 76~\% (19/25). Seventeen (65.38~\%) patients responded favorably to pleurodesis. As for the case series, the mean age was 51.5-63.0~years and 83 patients were male. The pooled prevalence of ascites was 90~\% (95~\% CI 81-97~\%) in 7 studies including 71 patients. The complete response rate after pleurodesis was reported in all studies, and the pooled rate was 72~\% (95~\% CI 65-79~\%). Complications related to pleurodesis were reported in 6 studies including 63 patients, and the pooled rate was 82~\% (95~\% CI 66-94~\%). CONCLUSION: Pleurodesis may be a promising treatment for HH, but carries a high rate of complications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to analyze the outcomes of thoracoscopic mesh repair for hepatic hydrothorax (HH) at our institution during the past 10 years. METHODS: A total of 63 patients with refractory HH who underwent thoracoscopic mesh onlay reinforcement to repair diaphragmatic defects from January 2005 to December 2014 were included in the study. Mesh covering alone was used in 47 patients and mesh with suturing was used in 16 patients. Patient demographics, Child-Pugh class, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score were evaluated to predict morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of the patients (mean age, 60.4 {\textpm} 15 years; 31 men and 32 women), 14.3\% had concomitant underlying diseases of renal insufficiency, 34.9\% had diabetes mellitus, and 4.8\% had pneumonia. Diaphragmatic blebs were the most common diaphragmatic defects (29 of 63 [46\%]). After a median 20.5 months of follow-up examinations, 4 patients experienced recurrence. The 1-month mortality rate was 9.5\% (6 of 63 patients). On multivariable analysis, underlying impaired renal function (p~= 0.039) and MELD scores (p~= 0.048) were associated with increased 3-month mortality in 16 patients. Contrary to the rising Child-Pugh score (p~= 0.058), rising MELD scores represented an increase in kidney or liver failure and mortality. The main causes of 3-month mortality were septic shock (n~= 6), acute renal insufficiency (n~=~4), gastrointestinal bleeding (n~= 4), hepatic encephalopathy (n~= 1), and ischemic bowel (n~= 1). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic mesh repair for refractory HH improves symptoms and lowers the recurrence rate.},

Percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI)  is the most effective method for treating CHD. However, in-stent restenosis  (ISR), a long-term complication after PCI, affects the prognosis of patients with  CHD. Previous studies have suggested that hypersensitivity reactions induced by  metallic components may be one of the reasons of this complication. With the  emergence of first- and second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), the efficacy  and prognosis of patients with CHD have greatly improved, and the incidence of  ISR has gradually decreased to less than 10\%. Nevertheless, DES components have  been reported to induce hypersensitivity reactions, either individually or  synergistically, and cause local inflammation and neointima formation, leading to  long-term adverse cardiovascular events. In this article, we described the  relationship between ISR and hypersensitivity from different perspectives,  including its possible pathogenesis, and discussed their potential influencing  factors and clinical significance.},

We sought to assess the quality of OCT pullbacks and identify the causes of suboptimal image acquisition. We evaluated 784 (404 pre-PCI; 380 post-PCI) coronary pullbacks from an anonymized OCT database from our Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory. Imaging of the region-of-interest (ROI-lesion or stented segment plus references) was incomplete in 16.1\% pullbacks, caused by pullback starting too proximal (63.7\%), inappropriate pullback length (17.1\%) and pullback starting too distal (11.4\%). The quality of image acquisition was excellent in 36.3\% pullbacks; whereas 4\% pullbacks were unanalyzable. Pullback quality was most commonly affected by poor blood displacement from inadequate contrast volume (27.4\%) or flow (25.6\%), followed by artifacts (24.1\%). Acquisition mode was 'High-Resolution' (54~mm) in 74.4\% and 'Survey' (75~mm) in 25.6\% of cases. The 54~mm mode was associated with incomplete ROI imaging (p\,=\,0.020) and inadequate contrast volume (p\,=\,0.035). We observed a substantial frequency of suboptimal image acquisition and identified its causes, most of which can be addressed with minor modifications during the procedure, ultimately improving patient outcomes.},

Consequently, many physicians and first responders are now considering fentanyl as an alternative. We conducted a single-centre trial randomizing cardiac patients undergoing coronary angiography to intravenous fentanyl or not. All participants received local anaesthetic and intravenous midazolam. Those requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting received 180 mg oral ticagrelor intra-procedurally. The primary outcome was area under the ticagrelor plasma concentration--time curve (AUC\textsubscript{0--24 hours}). The secondary outcomes were platelet function assessed at 2 hours after loading, measured by P2Y\textsubscript{12} reaction units (PRUs) and light transmission platelet aggregometry. Troponin-I was measured post-PCI using a high-sensitivity troponin-I assay (hs-TnI). All participants completed a survey of pain and anxiety. Of the 212 randomized, 70 patients required coronary stenting and were loaded with ticagrelor. Two participants in the no-fentanyl arm crossed over to receive fentanyl for pain. In as-treated analyses, ticagrelor concentrations were higher in the no-fentanyl arm (AUC\textsubscript{0--24 hours} 70\% larger, \emph{p} = 0.03). Platelets were more inhibited by 2 hours in the no-fentanyl arm (71 vs. 113 by PRU, \emph{p} = 0.03, and 25\% vs. 41\% for adenosine diphosphate response by platelet aggregation, \emph{p} {$<$} 0.01). Mean hs-TnI was higher with fentanyl at 2 hours post-PCI (11.9 vs. 7.0 ng/L, \emph{p} = 0.04) with a rate of enzymatic myocardial infarction of 11\% for fentanyl and 0\% for no-fentanyl (\emph{p} = 0.08). No statistical differences in self-reported pain or anxiety were found. In conclusion, fentanyl administration can impair ticagrelor absorption and delay platelet inhibition, resulting in mild excess of myocardial damage. This newly described drug interaction should be recognized by physicians and suggests that the interaction between opioids and oral P2Y\textsubscript{12} platelet inhibitors is a drug class effect associated with all opioids.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$} \textbf{Clinical Trial Registration:} {$<$}ext-link href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02683707"{$>$}https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02683707{$<$}/ext-link{$>$} \textbf{(}NCT02683707).{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this case, the hepatic hydrothorax, which was refractory to thoracic tube drainage and octreotide treatment, could be controlled with 5 days of terlipressin therapy associated with albumin. Terlipressin administration resulted in both improvement in renal function and successful resolution of hepatic hydrothorax. Splanchnic vasoconstrictor agents that reduce splanchnic blood flow, increase both central volume and effective renal blood flow. Thus they improve renal function. In our case, terlipressin, known to be beneficial in hepatorenal syndrome, was also effective in the treatment of hepatic hydrothorax probably by similar mechanisms. This is the first case in the literature.},

  abstract = {Background: Morphine reduces absorption and delays action onset of potent oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitors in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We sought to determine the differential effects of fentanyl compared to morphine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: PERSEUS (NCT02531165) was a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled study. Patients with STEMI who required analgesia were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with intravenous fentanyl or morphine after ticagrelor loading dose (LD) administration. The primary endpoint was platelet reactivity at 2 hours after ticagrelor LD assessed by P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). Results: The study was prematurely stopped in June 2017 after enrolment of 38 out of 56 planned patients. PRU at 2 hours following ticagrelor LD was 173.3 {\textpm} 89.7 in the fentanyl group and 210.3 {\textpm} 76.4 in the morphine group (p = 0.179). At 4 hours, PRU was significantly lower among patients treated with fentanyl as compared to those treated with morphine (90.1 {\textpm} 97.4 vs. 168.0 {\textpm} 72.2; p = 0.011). Maximal plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and its active metabolite AR-C124910XX tended to be delayed and numerically lower among patients treated with morphine compared to fentanyl. Total exposures to ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX within 6 hours after ticagrelor LD were numerically greater among patients treated with fentanyl compared to those treated with morphine. Conclusions: In patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, fentanyl did not improve platelet inhibition at 2 hours after ticagrelor pre-treatment compared with morphine. Fentanyl may, however, accelerate ticagrelor absorption and increase platelet inhibition at 4 hours compared to morphine. (Cardiol J 2022; 29, 4: 591--600)},

In preclinical and  intravascular imaging studies, the Orsiro BP-DES was shown to induce low  inflammation and promote very early arterial healing. Recently, large randomized  non-inferiority clinical trials have shown similar short- and mid-term efficacy  and safety outcomes with Orsiro BP-DES compared with currently established  newer-generation DES among all-comers and high-risk subgroups.

Compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) and early-generation thick-strut polymer-based drug-eluting stents (DES), newer-generation DES with thinner strut stent platforms and durable or biodegradable polymers have been shown to improve long-term safety and efficacy outcomes among patients with STEMI. Accordingly, the use of newer-generation DES over BMS is currently recommended by the most recent guidelines. Vessel healing at the culprit site after DES implantation is however substantially delayed in patients with acute STEMI as compared to those with chronic coronary syndromes and is associated with a long-term risk for recurrent stent-related adverse clinical outcomes. These findings highlight the need for future iterations in modern DES technology to further improve clinical outcomes following PCI in this highest-risk patient subset. Current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of aspirin and a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for 12 months after primary PCI for STEMI, unless there are contraindications such as excessive risk of bleeding. A recent meta-analysis of five large-scale randomized clinical trials including a total of 32\&\#x27;145 patients, of whom 4,070 (12.7\%) patients were treated for STEMI, indicated that 1-3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor-based single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after second-generation DES implantation in patients with chronic and acute coronary syndromes was associated with lower risk for major bleeding and similar risk for stent thrombosis, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with conventional DAPT. These findings suggest that a potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based SAPT following a short DAPT course (1-3 months) may represent a preferable treatment option, which is associated with similar ischemic, but lower bleeding risk, for patients undergoing PCI with newer-generation DES compared to standard conventional 12 months DAPT. The question of whether SAPT using a potent oral P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel) without aspirin (aspirin-free strategy) after primary PCI with a newest-generation thin-strut polymer-free drug-eluting stent is safe and effective compared to a conventional guideline-recommended 6- to 12-month DAPT course among patients with STEMI remains uncertain.},

Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy has been a standard procedure for biliary reconstruction in LDLT with a partial hepatic graft. However, end-to-end choledochocholedochostomy is the technique of choice for biliary reconstruction and yields a more physiologic bilioenteric continuity than can be achieved with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The authors performed right lobe LDLT with end-to-end duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis, and this study assessed retrospectively the relation between the manner of reconstruction and complications. METHODS: Between July 1999 and December 2000, 51 patients (11-67 years of age) underwent 52 right lobe LDLTs with duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction and remained alive more than 1 month after their transplantation. Interrupted biliary anastomosis was performed for 24 transplants and the continuous procedure was used for 28. A biliary tube was inserted downward into the common bile ducts through the recipient's cystic duct in 16 transplants (cystic drainage), or a biliary stent tube was pushed upward into the anastomosis through the cystic duct in four transplants (cystic stent), or upward into the anastomosis through the wall of the common bile duct in 31 transplants (external stent). RESULTS: Biliary anastomotic procedures consisted of 34 single end-to-end anastomoses, 11 double end-to-end anastomoses, and 7 single anastomoses for double hepatic ducts. Overall, 5 patients developed leakage (9.6\%) and 12 patients suffered stricture (23.0\%). For biliary anastomosis with interrupted suture, the incidence of stricture was significantly higher in the cystic drainage group (53.3\%, 8/15) than in the stent group consisting of cystic stent and external stent (0\%, 0/8). While the respective incidences of leakage and stricture were 20\% and 53.3\% for intermittent suture with a cystic drainage tube (n = 15), they were 7.7\% and 15.4\% for a continuous suture with an external stent (n = 26). There was a significant difference in the incidence of stricture. CONCLUSIONS: Duct-to-duct reconstruction with continuous suture combined with an external stent represents a useful technique for LDLT utilizing the right lobe, but biliary complications remain significant.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity and has been subject to important changes in management. The VHD II survey was designed by the EURObservational Research Programme of the European Society of Cardiology to analyze actual management of VHD and to compare practice with guidelines. METHODS: Patients with severe native VHD or previous valvular intervention were enrolled prospectively across 28 countries over a 3-month period in 2017. Indications for intervention were considered concordant if the intervention was performed or scheduled in symptomatic patients, corresponding to Class I recommendations specified in the 2012 European Society of Cardiology and in the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology VHD guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 7247 patients (4483 hospitalized, 2764 outpatients) were included in 222 centers. Median age was 71 years (interquartile range, 62-80 years); 1917 patients (26.5\%) were {$\geq$}80 years; and 3416 were female (47.1\%). Severe native VHD was present in 5219 patients (72.0\%): aortic stenosis in 2152 (41.2\% of native VHD), aortic regurgitation in 279 (5.3\%), mitral stenosis in 234 (4.5\%), mitral regurgitation in 1114 (21.3\%; primary in 746 and secondary in 368), multiple left-sided VHD in 1297 (24.9\%), and right-sided VHD in 143 (2.7\%). Two thousand twenty-eight patients (28.0\%) had undergone previous valvular intervention. Intervention was performed in 37.0\% and scheduled in 26.8\% of patients with native VHD. The decision for intervention was concordant with Class I recommendations in symptomatic patients with severe single left-sided native VHD in 79.4\% (95\% CI, 77.1-81.6) for aortic stenosis, 77.6\% (95\% CI, 69.9-84.0) for aortic regurgitation, 68.5\% (95\% CI, 60.8-75.4) for mitral stenosis, and 71.0\% (95\% CI, 66.4-75.3) for primary mitral regurgitation. Valvular interventions were performed in 2150 patients during the survey; of them, 47.8\% of patients with single left-sided native VHD were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Transcatheter procedures were performed in 38.7\% of patients with aortic stenosis and 16.7\% of those with mitral regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite good concordance between Class I recommendations and practice in patients with aortic VHD, the suboptimal number in mitral VHD and late referral for valvular interventions suggest the need to improve further guideline implementation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measures the drop in perfusion pressure across a stenosis, therefore representing its physiological effect on myocardial blood flow. Its use is widespread in percutaneous coronary interventions, though its role in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery remains uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate current evidence on outcomes following FFR-guided CABG compared to angiography-guided CABG. METHODS: A literature search was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to identify all relevant articles. Patient demographics and characteristics were extracted. The following outcomes were analysed: repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Pooled relative risks were analysed and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using random-effects models; P-value {$<$}0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q score and quantified by I2 index. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1146 patients (FFR: 574, angiography: 572) were included. There was no difference in MI or repeat revascularization between the 2 groups (relative risk 0.76, 95\% CI 0.41-1.43; P\,=\,0.40, and relative risk 1.28, 95\% CI 0.75-2.19; P\,=\,0.36, respectively). There was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in the FFR-guided CABG group compared to angiography-guided CABG, which was not specifically cardiac related (relative risk 0.58, 95\% CI 0.38-0.90; P\,=\,0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There was no reduction in repeat revascularization or postoperative MI with FFR. In this fairly small cohort, FFR-guided CABG provided a reduction in mortality, but this was not reported to be due to cardiac causes. There may be a role for FFR in CABG, but large-scale randomized trials are required to establish its value.},

  abstract = {Although drug-eluting stents are still the default interventional treatment of coronary artery disease, drug-coated balloons (DCBs) represent a novel  alternative therapeutic strategy in certain anatomic conditions. The effect of  DCBs is based on the fast and homogenous transfer of antiproliferative drugs into  the vessel wall during single balloon inflation by means of a lipophilic matrix  without the use of permanent implants. Although their use is established for  in-stent restenosis of both bare-metal and drug-eluting stents, recent randomized  clinical data demonstrate a good efficacy and safety profile in de novo  small-vessel disease and high bleeding risk. In addition, there are other  emerging indications (e.g., bifurcation lesions, large-vessel disease, diabetes  mellitus, acute coronary syndromes). Because the interaction among the different  delivery balloon designs, doses, formulations, and release kinetics of the drugs  used is important, there seems to be no "class effect" of DCBs. On the basis of  the amount of recently published data, the International DCB Consensus Group  provides this update of previous recommendations summarizing the historical  background, technical considerations such as choice of device and implantation  technique, possible indications, and future perspectives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of de-novo coronary small vessel disease, drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are non-inferior to drug-eluting stents (DESs)  regarding clinical outcome up to 12 months, but data beyond 1 year is sparse. We  aimed to test the long-term efficacy and safety of DCBs regarding clinical  endpoints in an all-comer population undergoing percutaneous coronary  intervention. METHODS: In this prespecified long-term follow-up of a multicentre,  randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, patients from 14 clinical sites in  Germany, Switzerland, and Austria with de-novo lesions in coronary vessels {$<$}3 mm  and an indication for percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned  1:1 to DCB or second-generation DES and followed over 3 years for major adverse  cardiac events (ie, cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and  target-vessel revascularisation [TVR]), all-cause death, probable or definite  stent thrombosis, and major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium  bleeding type 3-5). Analyses were performed on the full analysis set according to  the modified intention-to-treat principle. Dual antiplatelet therapy was  recommended for 1 month after DCB and 6 months after DES with stable symptoms,  but 12 months with acute coronary syndromes. The study is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01574534 and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between April 10, 2012,  and Feb 1, 2017, of 883 patients assessed, 758 (86\%) patients were randomly  assigned to the DCB group (n=382) or the DES group (n=376). The Kaplan-Meier  estimate of the rate of major adverse cardiac events was 15\% in both the DCB and  DES groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}99, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}68-1{$\cdot$}45; p=0{$\cdot$}95). The two groups  were also very similar concerning the single components of adverse cardiac  events: cardiac death (Kaplan-Meier estimate 5\% vs 4\%, HR 1{$\cdot$}29, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}63-2{$\cdot$}66;  p=0{$\cdot$}49), non-fatal myocardial infarction (both Kaplan-Meier estimate 6\%, HR 0{$\cdot$}82,  95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}45-1{$\cdot$}51; p=0{$\cdot$}52), and TVR (both Kaplan-Meier estimate 9\%, HR 0{$\cdot$}95, 95\%  CI 0{$\cdot$}58-1{$\cdot$}56; p=0{$\cdot$}83). Rates of all-cause death were very similar in DCB versus  DES patients (both Kaplan-Meier estimate 8\%, HR 1{$\cdot$}05, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}62-1{$\cdot$}77; p=0{$\cdot$}87).  Rates of probable or definite stent thrombosis (Kaplan-Meier estimate 1\% vs 2\%;  HR 0{$\cdot$}33, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}07-1{$\cdot$}64; p=0{$\cdot$}18) and major bleeding (Kaplan-Meier estimate 2\%  vs 4\%, HR 0{$\cdot$}43, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}17-1{$\cdot$}13; p=0{$\cdot$}088) were numerically lower in DCB versus  DES, however without reaching significance. INTERPRETATION: There is maintained  efficacy and safety of DCB versus DES in the treatment of de-novo coronary small  vessel disease up to 3 years.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined human drug-eluting stents (DES) to determine the long-term effects of these stents on coronary arterial healing and identified  mechanisms underlying late stent thrombosis (LST). BACKGROUND: Although DES  reduce the need for repeat revascularization compared with bare-metal stents  (BMS), data suggest the window of thrombotic risk for Cypher (Cordis Corp., Miami  Lakes, Florida) and Taxus (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, Massachusetts) DES  extends far beyond that for BMS. METHODS: From a registry of 40 autopsies of DES  (68 stents), 23 DES cases of {$>$}30 days duration were compared with 25 matched  autopsies of BMS implantation. Late stent thrombosis was defined as an acute  thrombus within a stent {$>$}30 days old. RESULTS: Of 23 patients with DES {$>$}30 days  old, 14 had evidence of LST. Cypher and Taxus DES showed greater delayed healing  characterized by persistent fibrin deposition (fibrin score 2.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.9  +/- 0.8, p = 0.0001) and poorer endothelialization (55.8 +/- 26.5\%) compared with  BMS (89.8 +/- 20.9, p = 0.0001). Moreover, DES with LST showed more delayed  healing compared with patent DES. In 5 of 14 patients suffering LST, antiplatelet  therapy had been withdrawn. Additional procedural and pathologic risk factors for  LST were: 1) local hypersensitivity reaction; 2) ostial and/or bifurcation  stenting; 3) malapposition/incomplete apposition; 4) restenosis; and 5) strut  penetration into a necrotic core. CONCLUSIONS: The Cypher and Taxus DES result in  delayed arterial healing when compared with BMS of similar implant duration. The  cause of DES LST is multifactorial with delayed healing in combination with other  clinical and procedural risk factors playing a role.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of the implementation of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and multidisciplinary heart team programme on mortality in severe aortic stenosis (AS). METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was performed using the echocardiography, cardiothoracic surgery and TAVR databases between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2016. Outcomes were compared between the pre- and post-TAVR programme eras in a tertiary referral centre providing transcatheter and surgical interventions for AS.All-cause mortality within 5 years from diagnosis was determined for 3399 patients with echocardiographically defined severe AS. RESULTS: Of 3399 patients, there were 210 deaths (6.2\%) at 30 days and 1614 deaths (47.5\%) at 5 years.Overall, patients diagnosed in the post-TAVR programme era were older, with a lower ejection fraction and more severe AS, but were less comorbid.Among 705 patients undergoing intervention, those in the post-TAVR programme era were older, with a lower ejection fraction and more severe AS but no significant differences in comorbidities.Using an inverse probability weighted cohort and a Cox proportional hazards model, a significant mortality benefit was noted between eras alone (HR=0.86, 95\%\,CI 0.77 to 0.97, p=0.015). When matching for age, comorbidities and valve severity, this benefit was more evident (HR=0.82, 95\%\,CI 0.73 to 0.92, p=0.001).After adjusting for the presence of aortic valve intervention, a significant benefit persisted (HR=0.84, 95\%\,CI 0.75 to 0.95, p=0.005). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a TAVR programme is associated with a mortality benefit in the population with severe AS, independent of the expansion of access to intervention.},

  abstract = {Background The impact of artificial intelligence (AI)--based computer-aided detection (CAD) software has not been prospectively explored in real-world populations. Purpose To investigate whether commercial AI-based CAD software could improve the detection rate of actionable lung nodules on chest radiographs in participants undergoing health checkups. Materials and Methods In this single-center, pragmatic, open-label randomized controlled trial, participants who underwent chest radiography between July 2020 and December 2021 in a health screening center were enrolled and randomized into intervention (AI group) and control (non-AI group) arms. One of three designated radiologists with 13--36 years of experience interpreted each radiograph, referring to the AI-based CAD results for the AI group. The primary outcome was the detection rate, that is, the number of true-positive radiographs divided by the total number of radiographs, of actionable lung nodules confirmed on CT scans obtained within 3 months. Actionable nodules were defined as solid nodules larger than 8 mm or subsolid nodules with a solid portion larger than 6 mm (Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System, or Lung-RADS, category 4). Secondary outcomes included the positive-report rate, sensitivity, false-referral rate, and malignant lung nodule detection rate. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups using univariable logistic regression analyses. Results A total of 10\,476 participants (median age, 59 years [IQR, 50--66 years]; 5121 men) were randomized to an AI group (n = 5238) or non-AI group (n = 5238). The trial met the predefined primary outcome, demonstrating an improved detection rate of actionable nodules in the AI group compared with the non-AI group (0.59\% [31 of 5238 participants] vs 0.25\% [13 of 5238 participants], respectively; odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% CI: 1.3, 4.7; P = .008). The detection rate for malignant lung nodules was higher in the AI group compared with the non-AI group (0.15\% [eight of 5238 participants] vs 0.0\% [0 of 5238 participants], respectively; P = .008). The AI and non-AI groups showed similar false-referral rates (45.9\% [56 of 122 participants] vs 56.0\% [56 of 100 participants], respectively; P = .14) and positive-report rates (2.3\% [122 of 5238 participants] vs 1.9\% [100 of 5238 participants]; P = .14). Conclusion In health checkup participants, artificial intelligence--based software improved the detection of actionable lung nodules on chest radiographs. {\copyright} RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-liver-transplant biliary anastomotic strictures (ASs) are currently managed with repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) inserting multiple plastic stents. Fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FCSEMSs) are being increasingly reported in the management of this condition, however no prospective randomized trials have been performed to date. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether FCSEMSs decrease overall numbers of ERCPs needed to achieve stricture resolution and to establish the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness in this setting. METHODS: Two tertiary referral centres performed this open-label prospective randomized trial. A total of 32 patients consented and subsequently 20 were randomized with 10 in the FCSEMS arm and 10 in the plastic arm. The FCSEMS arm had the stent in situ for 12 weeks with the plastic stent arm undergoing 3-monthly multiple plastic stenting with or without dilatation over a year. RESULTS: The median number of ERCPs performed per patient in the FCSEMS was 2 versus 4.5 (p = 0.0001) in the plastic stenting arm. Stricture resolution was achieved in all 10 patients with FCSEMSs compared with 8/10 in the plastic arm [p = not significant (NS)]. Complications occurred in 1/10 patients in the FCSEMS arm versus 5/10 in the plastic arm (p = 0.051). Days in hospital for complications was 6 in the FCSEMS versus 56 in the plastic arm (p = 0.11). Cost analysis shows that the FCSEMS arm was more cost effective. No cases of FCSEMS migration were seen. CONCLUSIONS: FCSEMSs reduced the number of ERCPs needed to achieve stricture resolution with similar recurrence rates between arms. The FCSEMSs may do so with fewer complications making it cost effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel quantitative flow ratio ({$\mu$}QFR) for bifurcated coronary vessels, derived from a single projection, has been recently reported.  Provisional stenting is effective for most bifurcation lesions. However, the  clinical value of the side branch (SB) {$\mu$}QFR in patients with coronary bifurcation  lesions undergoing provisional stenting remains unclear. AIMS: This study aims to  determine the clinical predictive value of the SB {$\mu$}QFR after provisional stenting  in patients with coronary bifurcation lesions. METHODS: Between June 2015 and May  2018, 288 patients with true coronary bifurcation lesions who underwent a  provisional approach without SB treatment (including predilation, kissing balloon  inflation or stenting) were classified by an SB {$\mu$}QFR {$<$}0.8 (n=65) and {$\geq$}0.8 (n=223)  groups. The primary endpoint was the three-year composite of target vessel  failure (TVF), including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction  (TVMI), and revascularisation (TVR). RESULTS: Three years after the procedures,  there were 43 (14.9\%) TVFs, with 19 (29.2\%) in the SB {$\mu$}QFR {$<$}0.8 and 24 (10.8\%) in  the SB {$\mu$}QFR {$\geq$}0.8 groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.45, 95\% confidence interval  [CI] 1.39-5.54; p=0.003), mainly driven by increased TVMI (16.9\% vs 5.4\%,  adjusted HR 3.29, 95\% CI: 1.15-6.09; p=0.030) and TVR (15.4\% vs 2.2\%, adjusted HR  6.39, 95\% CI: 2.04-13.48; p=0.007). Baseline diameter stenosis at the ostial SB  and SB lesion length were the two predictors of an SB {$\mu$}QFR {$<$}0.8 immediately after  stenting the main vessel, whereas previous percutaneous coronary intervention and  an SB {$\mu$}QFR {$<$}0.8 were the two independent factors of 3-year TVF. CONCLUSIONS: An  SB {$\mu$}QFR {$<$}0.8 immediately after the provisional approach is strongly associated  with clinical events. Further randomised studies with large patient populations  are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of fractional flow reserve (FFR) on clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: Five online databases were searched for studies that (1) enrolled patients who underwent isolated CABG or CABG with aortic valve replacement and (2) demonstrated the effect of an FFR-guided strategy on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after surgery based on a randomized controlled trial or adjusted analysis. MACE included cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and repeated revascularization. The primary outcomes were all MACE outcomes and a composite of all-cause death and MI, and the secondary outcomes were the individual MACE outcomes. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and the Egger test. RESULTS: Six articles (3 randomized and 3 non-randomized studies: n=1,027) were selected. MACE data were extracted from 4 studies. The pooled analyses showed that the risk of MACE was not significantly different between patients who underwent FFR-guided CABG and those who underwent angiography-guided CABG (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.57-1.12). However, the risk of the composite of death or MI was significantly lower in patients undergoing FFR-guided CABG (HR, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.94). The individual MACE outcomes were not significantly different between FFR-guided and angiography-guided CABG. CONCLUSION: FFR-guided CABG might be beneficial in terms of the composite outcome of death or MI compared with angiography-guided CABG although data are limited.},

Baseline clinical and lesion characteristics were similar,  except that SR lesions had larger diameter. In SR lesions, specialty balloons  were more frequently utilized (p\,=\,0.025), and maximal balloon diameter and  balloon-to-artery ratio were significantly greater compared to Non-SR lesions  (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 and p\,=\,0.008). At a median 8-month follow-up, SR lesions exhibited  larger minimal luminal diameter (MLD) and lower late lumen loss, with negative  values indicating positive vessel remodeling. In multivariate analysis, post-DCB  MLD (odds ratio 1.17 per 0.1~mm increase, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and balloon-to-artery ratio  (odds ratio 1.43 per 0.1 increase, p\,=\,0.002) were independent predictors for  successful angiographic outcomes with thresholds of 1.95~mm for post-DCB MLD and  1.13 for balloon-to-artery ratio. In 47 patients, IVUS guidance resulted in  balloon-to-artery ratio of 1.23 as calculated by QCA.

METHODS: A total of 267 patients with STEMI successfully treated  with primary coronary intervention were retrospectively analyzed. Patients was  divided into four groups according to length of hospitalization: 24 hours, 48  hours, 72 hours, and more than 72 hours. The groups were compared in terms of the  patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, short- and long-term  follow-up results, mortality, revascularization and major adverse cardiac events  (MACE). RESULTS: More than two thirds of the patients were discharged within 48  hours (68.9\%). No difference was observed between groups in terms of one month  and one year MACE and one year restenosis. However, one month restenosis was  slightly higher in the fourth group. At the end of the first year, there had been  only four deaths, and these were in the third and fourth groups. There were no  deaths among patients discharged within 48 hours. Killip class, left ventricular  ejection fraction, multi-vessel disease and diabetes were the major determinants  of length of stay in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Very early discharge is safe and  feasible and does not increase the mortality rate. Uncomplicated STEMI patients  with single vessel disease could be discharged after 24 hours. Patients with  multi-vessel disease classified in the low risk group could be discharged after  48 hours.},

In a previous study, we  described a quality improvement intervention that reduced D2B time in 333  patients with STEMI. The aim of the current study was to compare mortality rates  of the patients, before and after the intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: We  examined the survival of 133 consecutive patients with STEMI treated prior to an  intervention to decrease D2B time and 200 treated after the intervention. The  mortality rate was the same before and after the quality intervention. The median  D2B time for the entire cohort was 55\,min. The number of patients with D2B time  {$>$}55\,min prior to the intervention was 82/133 (61\%) and after the intervention  74/200 (37\%) P\,{$<$}\,0.00001. Thirty-day mortality among the patients with D2B time  {$\leq$}55\,min was 5/178 (2.8\%) and among those with D2B time {$>$}55\,min was 15/155 (9.7\%),  P\,{$<$}\,0.008. The hazard ratio for 30-day mortality when the D2B time was {$>$}55\,min  was 3.7 (1.3-10.4). CONCLUSION: Mortality and non-fatal complications did not  differ significantly between STEMI patients before and after a quality  improvement intervention. However, the number of patients treated within 55\,min  from arrival was significantly higher after the intervention; and coronary  intervention within this time was associated with a lower death rate.},

However, its use has been expanding in recent years to include intermediate- and low-risk patients. Thus, registry data describing changes in patient characteristics and outcomes are needed. The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal changes in patient profiles and clinical outcomes of all-comer TAVR. Methods: Baseline characteristics and VARC-3 outcomes of 1632 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR between 2008 and 2021 were analysed. Results: The annual rate of TAVR increased from 30 procedures in 2008-2009 to 398 in 2020-2021. Over the follow-up period, patient age decreased from 85 {\textpm} 4 to 80 {\textpm} 6.8 (p {$<$} 0.001) and the STS score decreased from 5.9\% to 2.8\% (p {$<$} 0.001). Procedural characteristics significantly changed, representing a shift into a minimally invasive approach: adoption of local anaesthesia (none to 48\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and preference of transfemoral access (74\% in 2011-2012 vs. 94.5\% in 2020-2021, p {$<$} 0.001). The rates of almost all procedural complications decreased, including major vascular and bleeding complications, acute kidney injury (AKI) and in-hospital heart failure. There was a striking decline in rates of complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) and the need for a permanent pacemaker (PPM). PPM rates, however, remain high (17.8\%). Thirty-day and one-year mortality significantly declined to 1.8\% and 8.3\%, respectively. Multivariable analysis shows that AKI, bleeding and stroke are strong predictors of one-year mortality (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: The TAVR procedure has changed dramatically during the last 14 years in terms of patient characteristics, procedural aspects and device maturity. These shifts have led to improved procedural safety, contributing to improved short- and long-term patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Grafts to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) are generally placed in the distal, most accessible part of the vessel. As a result, there is a segment of variable length between the site of stenosis on the LAD and the site of graft placement. This segment is perfused in a retrograde unphysiological manner and is prone to the development of atherosclerosis and rapid progression of preexisting atherosclerosis. Placing the graft close to the site of stenosis has the potential to reduce the length of the arterial segment, which can become occluded or severely diseased. This holds important implications for the performance of percutaneous interventions in the event of graft failure, and possibly also for perfusion to the myocardium supplied by this segment even when the graft is patent. However, because of the tendency for rupture-prone plaques to segregate in the proximal portions of coronary arteries, a strategy of proximal graft placement might not provide the same protection from the effects of plaque rupture as the traditional distal graft placement. Despite their obvious clinical implications, these factors do not influence the site of graft placement in current practice. In this review, we attempt to quantify these opposing influences and present a theoretical framework for choosing the site of graft placement on the LAD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify predictors of decision delay time for health care seeking among Jordanians with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). DESIGN: The study was a  cross-sectional descriptive survey. A convenience sample of Jordanians with AMI  were interviewed at the coronary care units of two teaching hospitals in Jordan.  METHODS: The Arabic version of the modified Response to Symptom Questionnaire was  used to assess predictors of decision delay and patterns of health care-seeking  behaviors. Decision delay was evaluated by assisting patients to triangulate time  of symptom onset and time of decision to seek professional health care by placing  both times in context of daily activities that participants could easily  remember. Regression analysis was conducted to elicit predictors of decision  delay. FINDINGS: Decision delay time among Jordanian men (n=110) and women (n=24)  with AMI was alarmingly long (medians 3.5 and 3.6 hours, respectively). Variables  that correspondingly predicted decision delay among men and women were age,  waiting for symptoms to go away, anxiety due to symptom presentation, and others'  responses to patients' symptoms. While 16 other variables (cognitive, emotional,  and clinical) independently predicted delay among men, equivalent evidence was  not established among women due to the relatively small sample size. CONCLUSIONS:  Similarities and differences existed between Jordanian men's and women's decision  delay to seek health care for AMI. Decision delay time among Jordanians with AMI  requires intervention that incorporates awareness of delay predictors. Future  research needs to utilize adequate sample sizes of both sexes to obtain a better  understanding of sex differences. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: To reduce decision delay  among Jordanians, health educators should emphasize early symptom recognition and  the value of prompt health care-seeking behaviors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current literature on predictors of pre-hospital delay among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). METHODS: Medline, CINHAL,  and Psych Info databases were searched using keywords: attitude to  illness/health, health beliefs, help/health seeking behavior, health behavior,  psychosocial factors, treatment delay, socioeconomic factors, time factors,  pre-hospital delay, and symptoms. These keywords were combined with AMI to  identify literature published during 1995-2008. RESULTS: Twenty-six data-based  research articles were identified. Delay varied across literature and median  pre-hospital delay was often reported due to distribution skewness resulting from  extremely prolonged values (1.5-15.2h). Six categories of predictors influenced  pre-hospital delay; socio-demographic, symptom onset context, cognitive,  affective/psychological, behavioral, and clinical factors. Pre-hospital delay was  shortest when the decision to seek healthcare was facilitated by family members  or coworkers and when symptoms suggestive of heart attack were continuous and  severe. CONCLUSION AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Developing interventions programs  to reduce pre-hospital delay for high-risk patients is warranted. Because  decision delay is the only modifiable part by intervention, it is recommended  that future investigations and interventions attend to decision time as the  primary variable of interest instead of combining it with transportation time.  Moreover, content of patient education need to emphasize on symptom awareness and  recognition, and prompt and proper patient actions for optimum results. Also, in  order to eliminate sampling bias resulting from investigating surviving AMI  patients, it is recommended that future studies incorporate data from both  surviving and surrogates of non-surviving AMI patients.},

However, there  were only a few studies that have focused on the clinical characteristics of  LCX-related AMI. We studied the clinical characteristics and hospital mortality  in patients with angiographically confirmed LCX-related AMI. A total of 2281 AMI  patients with single acutely occluded culprit vessel in coronary angiography  (pre-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow: 0) were enrolled in the Korea  Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR) from November 2005 to January 2008.  These patients were divided into three groups according to culprit vessel [left  anterior descending artery (LAD), right coronary artery (RCA), and LCX]. This  study showed the patients with LCX-related AMI were less likely to present with  ST elevation in ECG (46.3\%, 87.0\%, and 82.3\%; p{$<$}0.001) and primary percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI) (43.4\%, 78.9\%, and 74.5\%; p{$<$}0.001) and door to  balloon time {$<$}90 min (31.3\%, 52.8\%, and 51.0\%; p{$<$}0.001), compared with LAD and  RCA. However, no statistical difference was found in hospital mortality among the  three groups. Multivariate analysis showed primary PCI decreased the hospital  mortality in patients with occluded coronary artery. In conclusion, AMI patients  with an occluded LCX presented with less ST elevation and primary PCI. These  results suggest that clinical physicians should be careful with patients  presenting with chest pain but apparently normal ECG and must rule out LCX  occlusion.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Discontinuing aspirin after short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was evaluated as a bleeding reduction strategy. However, the strategy of ticagrelor monotherapy has not been exclusively evaluated in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether switching to ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT reduces net adverse clinical events compared with ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT in patients with ACS treated with drug-eluting stents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized multicenter trial was conducted in 3056 patients with ACS treated with drug-eluting stents between August 2015 and October 2018 at 38 centers in South Korea. Follow-up was completed in October 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice daily) after 3-month DAPT (n\,=\,1527) or ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT (n\,=\,1529). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a 1-year net adverse clinical event, defined as a composite of major bleeding and adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or target-vessel revascularization). Prespecified secondary outcomes included major bleeding and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. RESULTS: Among 3056 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61 years; 628 women [20\%]; 36\% ST-elevation myocardial infarction), 2978 patients (97.4\%) completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 59 patients (3.9\%) receiving ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT and in 89 patients (5.9\%) receiving ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT (absolute difference, -1.98\% [95\% CI, -3.50\% to -0.45\%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.92]; P\,=\,.01). Of 10 prespecified secondary outcomes, 8 showed no significant difference. Major bleeding occurred in 1.7\% of patients with ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT and in 3.0\% of patients with ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT (HR, 0.56 [95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.91]; P\,=\,.02). The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was not significantly different between the ticagrelor monotherapy after 3-month DAPT group (2.3\%) vs the ticagrelor-based 12-month DAPT group (3.4\%) (HR, 0.69 [95\% CI, 0.45 to 1.06]; P\,=\,.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with drug-eluting stents, ticagrelor monotherapy after 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy, compared with ticagrelor-based 12-month dual antiplatelet therapy, resulted in a modest but statistically significant reduction in a composite outcome of major bleeding and cardiovascular events at 1 year. The study population and lower than expected event rates should be considered in interpreting the trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02494895.},

Despite performing imaging and laboratory studies, we could not find a cause of the pleural effusion.

An intraperitoneal injection of a radioisotope demonstrated the transdiaphragmatic flow of fluid from peritoneal cavity to pleural cavity. The diagnosis was confirmed as hepatic hydrothorax.

  abstract = {A hepatic hydrothorax is a pleural effusion that develops in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the absence of cardiopulmonary disease. The pleural effusion is derived from ascitic fluid that enters the chest because of the negative pressure within the pleural space via defects in the diaphragm. The peritoneal-to-pleural flow of fluid can be demonstrated by nuclear scanning, even when the ascites is not clinically apparent. The pleural fluid usually has the characteristics of a transudate. However, an occasional patient with hepatic hydrothorax will develop spontaneous bacterial pleuritis manifest by increased pleural fluid neutrophils or a positive bacterial culture and will require antibiotic therapy. Treatment of the hydrothorax is directed at the underlying liver disease but a dyspneic patient can obtain relief from a thoracentesis or paracentesis. When medical therapy fails, liver transplantation is the treatment of choice. Both transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting and thoracoscopic repair of diaphragmatic defects with pleural sclerosis can provide symptomatic relief, but the morbidity and mortality of these procedures are high because of the fragile nature of the patients.},

BACKGROUND: Limited registry data support the use of intravascular imaging during uLMS PCI to improve outcomes. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 11,264 uLMS PCI procedures performed in England and Wales between 2007 and 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify associates of imaging use. Propensity matching created 5,056 pairs of subjects with and without imaging and logistic regression was performed to quantify the association between imaging and outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression to identify the independent predictors of 12-month mortality was performed. RESULTS: Imaging use increased from 30.2\% in 2007 to 50.2\% in 2014 (p for trend~{$<~$}0.001). The factors associated with imaging use included stable angina presentation (odds ratio [OR]: 1.200; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.147 to 1.246; p~{$<~$}0.001), bifurcation LMS disease (OR: 1.220; 95\%~CI: 1.140 to 1.300; p~{$<~$}0.001), previous PCI (OR: 1.320; 95\%~CI: 1.200 to 1.440; p~{$<~$}0.001), and radial access (OR: 1.266; 95\%~CI: 1.217 to 1.317; p~{$<~$}0.001). A lower rate of coronary complications, lower in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (OR: 0.470; 95\%~CI: 0.37 to 0.590; p~{$<~$}0.001), and improved 30-day (OR: 0.540; 95\%~CI: 0.430 to 0.680; p~{$<~$}0.001) and 12-month (OR: 0.660; 95\%~CI: 0.570 to 0.770; p~{$<~$}0.001) mortality were observed with imaging use compared with no imaging use. Greater mortality reductions were observed with higher operator LMS PCI volume. In logistic regression modeling, imaging use was associated with improved 12-month survival. CONCLUSIONS: The observed lower mortality with use of intravascular imaging to guide uLMS PCI justifies the undertaking of a large-scale randomized trial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Device-detected atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are atrial arrhythmias detected by implanted cardiac devices. AHREs resemble atrial fibrillation but are rare and brief. Whether the occurrence of AHREs in patients without atrial fibrillation (as documented on a conventional electrocardiogram [ECG]) justifies the initiation of anticoagulants is not known. METHODS: We conducted an event-driven, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial involving patients 65 years of age or older who had AHREs lasting for at least 6 minutes and who had at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive edoxaban or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism, evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. The safety outcome was a composite of death from any cause or major bleeding. RESULTS: The analysis population consisted of 2536 patients (1270 in the edoxaban group and 1266 in the placebo group). The mean age was 78 years, 37.4\% were women, and the median duration of AHREs was 2.8 hours. The trial was terminated early, at a median follow-up of 21 months, on the basis of safety concerns and the results of an independent, informal assessment of futility for the efficacy of edoxaban; at termination, the planned enrollment had been completed. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 83 patients (3.2\% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 101 patients (4.0\% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.08; P\,=\,0.15). The incidence of stroke was approximately 1\% per patient-year in both groups. A safety outcome event occurred in 149 patients (5.9\% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 114 patients (4.5\% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.67; P\,=\,0.03). ECG-diagnosed atrial fibrillation developed in 462 of 2536 patients (18.2\% total, 8.7\% per patient-year). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AHREs detected by implantable devices, anticoagulation with edoxaban did not significantly reduce the incidence of a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism as compared with placebo, but it led to a higher incidence of a composite of death or major bleeding. The incidence of stroke was low in both groups.

  abstract = {Background The optimal endpoint after balloon angioplasty remains poorly defined. This study aimed to characterize post-balloon angioplasty anatomical and physiological indexes by quantitative flow ratio (QFR) and to compare their prognostic impacts on long-term clinical outcomes. Methods This retrospective study included 106 lesions from 106 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions with drug-coated-balloon (n = 69) or plain-old-balloon-angioplasty (n = 37). Analyses measured minimum lumen diameter (MLD) and percent diameter stenosis (\%DS) as anatomical indexes; QFR of target vessel (QFR-vessel) and QFR-gradient ({$\Delta$}QFR between proximal and distal segments of the lesion) as physiological indexes. Primary endpoint was target lesion revascularization (TLR) after the index procedure. Results TLR occurred in 21 (20 \%) lesions. TLR group showed significantly smaller QFR-vessel (0.79 {\textpm} 0.12 vs. 0.85 {\textpm} 0.12, p = 0.03), as well as greater QFR-gradient (0.12 {\textpm} 0.07 vs. 0.04 {\textpm} 0.03, p {$<$} 0.0001) at post-procedure compared with non-TLR group. The percentage of angiographically significant dissection was also more frequently observed in TLR group compared with non-TLR group (47.6 \% vs. 14.1 \%, p {$<$} 0.0001 for log-rank). In the multivariate analysis, angiographically significant dissection and QFR-gradient at post-procedure was significantly associated with TLR. In the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, the area under the curve for predicting post-procedural TLR was significantly greater for QFR-gradient than for MLD and residual \%DS (p {$<$} 0.0001 for MLD and p = 0.0003 for residual \%DS at post-procedure). The best cut-off value of post-procedural QFR-gradient for predicting TLR was 0.08. Conclusions Post-procedural QFR-gradient across the lesion was a statistically independent and stronger predictor of TLR, compared with anatomical indexes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stent thrombosis is a lethal complication of endovascular intervention. Concern has been raised about the inherent risk associated with  specific stent designs and drug-eluting coatings, yet clinical and animal support  is equivocal. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined whether drug-eluting coatings are  inherently thrombogenic and if the response to these materials was determined to  a greater degree by stent design and deployment with custom-built stents.  Drug/polymer coatings uniformly reduce rather than increase thrombogenicity  relative to matched bare metal counterparts (0.65-fold; P=0.011). Thick-strutted  (162 {$\mu$}m) stents were 1.5-fold more thrombogenic than otherwise identical  thin-strutted (81 {$\mu$}m) devices in ex vivo flow loops (P{$<$}0.001), commensurate with  1.6-fold greater thrombus coverage 3 days after implantation in porcine coronary  arteries (P=0.004). When bare metal stents were deployed in malapposed or  overlapping configurations, thrombogenicity increased compared with apposed,  length-matched controls (1.58-fold, P=0.001; and 2.32-fold, P{$<$}0.001). The  thrombogenicity of polymer-coated stents with thin struts was lowest in all  configurations and remained insensitive to incomplete deployment. Computational  modeling-based predictions of stent-induced flow derangements correlated with  spatial distribution of formed clots. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to popular  perception, drug/polymer coatings do not inherently increase acute stent  clotting; they reduce thrombosis. However, strut dimensions and positioning  relative to the vessel wall are critical factors in modulating stent  thrombogenicity. Optimal stent geometries and surfaces, as demonstrated with thin  stent struts, help reduce the potential for thrombosis despite complex stent  configurations and variability in deployment.},

  abstract = {Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) poses diagnostic problems that may lead to a delay in  reperfusion. Methods\;and\;Results: From a group of 1,269 consecutive patients with  ACS, 138 patients with ACS due to LCX occlusion were analyzed for clinical,  electrocardiographic, and angiographic presentations, as well as door-to-balloon  (DTB) time. Electrocardiographic changes were classified into 4 patterns:  ST-segment elevation in inferior/lateral leads (ST-E); ST-segment depression in  V1-V4 (ST-D); no significant ST changes (No-ST); and others. The No-ST group was  associated with a longer DTB time (P{$<$}0.0001) compared with the ST-E and ST-D  groups. Compared with the No-ST and ST-E groups, the ST-D group presented with a  more advanced Killip class (P=0.003), greater peak creatine phosphokinase  (P=0.007) and peak creatine kinase-MB (P=0.006), more frequent proximal LCX  occlusion (P=0.007), and worse 1-year outcomes (P=0.0034). Conclusions: One-third  of ACS patients with LCX occlusion showed no ST-segment changes, resulting in  significantly longer DTB time. Improving diagnostic accuracy is challenging but  critical to avoid delayed reperfusion in these patients without  electrocardiographic changes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with coronary artery disease who are being evaluated for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), procedures can be guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) or intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) for decision making regarding revascularization and stent implantation. However, the differences in clinical outcomes when only one method is used for both purposes are unclear. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1682 patients who were being evaluated for PCI for the treatment of intermediate stenosis (40 to 70\% occlusion by visual estimation on coronary angiography) in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either an FFR-guided or IVUS-guided procedure. FFR or IVUS was to be used to determine whether to perform PCI and to assess PCI success. In the FFR group, PCI was to be performed if the FFR was 0.80 or less. In the IVUS group, the criteria for PCI were a minimal lumen area measuring either 3 mm(2) or less or measuring 3 to 4 mm(2) with a plaque burden of more than 70\%. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 24 months after randomization. We tested the noninferiority of the FFR group as compared with the IVUS group (noninferiority margin, 2.5 percentage points). RESULTS: The frequency of PCI was 44.4\% among patients in the FFR group and 65.3\% among those in the IVUS group. At 24 months, a primary-outcome event had occurred in 8.1\% of the patients in the FFR group and in 8.5\% of those in the IVUS group (absolute difference, -0.4 percentage points; upper boundary of the~one-sided 97.5\% confidence interval, 2.2 percentage points; P\,=\,0.01 for noninferiority). Patient-reported outcomes as reported on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with intermediate stenosis who were being evaluated for PCI, FFR guidance was noninferior to IVUS guidance with respect to the composite primary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization at 24 months.

The fast scanning speed and simple imaging procedure of new-generation frequency-domain OCT make this technology easy to use in the clinical setting. The OCT examination is useful for guidance and risk stratification of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). OCT-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma, which is characterized by large lipid-core and thin fibrous cap {$<$}65 {$\mu$}m, is a predictor of peri-PCI complications, such as angiographic no-reflow, microvascular obstruction, and post-PCI cardiac troponin I elevation. Stent malapposition, tissue protrusion, and stent edge dissection are assessed in more detail by OCT than with conventional intravascular imaging modalities. Neointimal coverage at strut level assessed by OCT could be a surrogate endpoint for quickly scrutinizing safety after drug-eluting stent implantation. The OCT findings of in-stent neoatherosclerosis, such as lipid-rich neointima, microvascular proliferation, and neointimal plaque rupture, are associated with very late stent failure, including thrombosis and restenosis. With its excellent ability to assess coronary atherosclerosis and to guide PCI, OCT provides new insights into interventional cardiology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with mental illness have been shown to receive lower quality of care and experience worse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes compared to those  without mental illness. This present study examined mental health-related  disparities in CV outcomes after an Emergency Department (ED) visit for chest  pain. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included adult Medicaid beneficiaries in  Washington state discharged from the ED with a primary diagnosis of unspecified  chest pain in 2010-2017. Outcomes for patients with any mental illness (any  mental health diagnosis or mental-health specific service use within 1 year of an  index ED visit) and serious mental illness (at least two claims (on different  dates of service) within 1 year of an index ED visit with a diagnosis of  schizophrenia, other psychotic disorder, or major mood disorder) were compared to  those of patients without mental illness. Our outcomes of interest were the  incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 30 days and 6 months of  discharge of their ED visit, defined as a composite of death, acute myocardial  infarction (AMI), CV rehospitalization, or revascularization. Secondary outcomes  included cardiovascular diagnostic testing (diagnostic angiography, stress  testing, echocardiography, and coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography)  rates within 30 days of ED discharge. Only treat-and-release visits were included  for outcomes assessment. Hierarchical logistic random effects regression models  assessed the association between mental illness and the outcomes of interest,  controlling for age, gender, race, ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidities, and  health care use in the past year, as well as fixed year effects. RESULTS: There  were 98,812 treat-and-release ED visits in our dataset. At 30 days, enrollees  with any mental illness had no differences in rates of MACE (AOR 0.96; 95\% CI,  0.72-1.27) or any of the individual components. At 6 months, enrollees with any  mental illness (AOR 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.11-3.09) and serious mental illness (AOR  2.60; 95\% CI 1.33-5.13) were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for a  CV condition compared to those without mental illness. Individuals with any  mental illness had higher rates of testing at 30 days (AOR 1.16; 95\% CI  1.07-1.27). CONCLUSION: Patients with mental illness have similar rates of MACE,  but higher rates of certain CV outcomes, such as CV hospitalization and  diagnostic testing, after an ED visit for chest pain.},

OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and reliability of using LLMs to assess risk of bias (ROB) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A survey study was conducted between August 10, 2023, and October 30, 2023. Thirty RCTs were selected from published systematic reviews. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A structured prompt was developed to guide ChatGPT (LLM 1) and Claude (LLM 2) in assessing the ROB in these RCTs using a modified version of the Cochrane ROB tool developed by the CLARITY group at McMaster University. Each RCT was assessed twice by both models, and the results were documented. The results were compared with an assessment by 3 experts, which was considered a criterion standard. Correct assessment rates, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores were calculated to reflect accuracy, both overall and for each domain of the Cochrane ROB tool; consistent assessment rates and Cohen {$\kappa$} were calculated to gauge consistency; and assessment time was calculated to measure efficiency. Performance between the 2 models was compared using risk differences. RESULTS: Both models demonstrated high correct assessment rates. LLM 1 reached a mean correct assessment rate of 84.5\% (95\% CI, 81.5\%-87.3\%), and LLM 2 reached a significantly higher rate of 89.5\% (95\% CI, 87.0\%-91.8\%). The risk difference between the 2 models was 0.05 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.09). In most domains, domain-specific correct rates were around 80\% to 90\%; however, sensitivity below 0.80 was observed in domains 1 (random sequence generation), 2 (allocation concealment), and 6 (other concerns). Domains 4 (missing outcome data), 5 (selective outcome reporting), and 6 had F1 scores below 0.50. The consistent rates between the 2 assessments were 84.0\% for LLM 1 and 87.3\% for LLM 2. LLM 1's {$\kappa$} exceeded 0.80 in 7 and LLM 2's in 8 domains. The mean (SD) time needed for assessment was 77 (16) seconds for LLM 1 and 53 (12) seconds for LLM 2. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey study of applying LLMs for ROB assessment, LLM 1 and LLM 2 demonstrated substantial accuracy and consistency in evaluating RCTs, suggesting their potential as supportive tools in systematic review processes.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Guidelines emphasize the importance of rapid reperfusion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and specify a maximum delay of 30  minutes for fibrinolysis and 90 minutes for primary percutaneous coronary  intervention (PPCI). However, randomized trials and selective registries are  limited in their ability to assess the effect of timeliness of reperfusion on  outcomes in real-world STEMI patients. OBJECTIVES: To obtain a complete  interregional portrait of contemporary STEMI care and to investigate timeliness  of reperfusion and outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Systematic evaluation  of STEMI care for 6 months during 2006-2007 in 80 hospitals that treated more  than 95\% of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the province of Quebec,  Canada (population, 7.8 million). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death at 30 days and at  1 year and the combined end point of death or hospital readmission for acute  myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure at 1 year by linkage to  Quebec's medicoadministrative databases. RESULTS: Of 1832 patients treated with  reperfusion, 392 (21.4\%) received fibrinolysis and 1440 (78.6\%) received PPCI.  Fibrinolysis was untimely ({$>$}30 minutes) in 54\% and PPCI was untimely ({$>$}90  minutes) in 68\%. Death or readmission for acute myocardial infarction or heart  failure at 1 year occurred in 13.5\% of fibrinolysis patients and 13.6\% of PPCI  patients. When the 2 treatment groups were combined, patients treated outside of  recommended delays had an adjusted higher risk of death at 30 days (6.6\% vs 3.3\%;  odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.93) and a  statistically nonsignificant increase in risk of death at 1 year (9.3\% vs 5.2\%;  OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.66) compared with patients who received timely  treatment. Patients treated outside of recommended delays also had an adjusted  higher risk for the combined outcome of death or hospital readmission for  congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction at 1 year (15.0\% vs 9.2\%;  OR, 1.57; 95\% CI, 1.08-2.30). At the regional level, after adjustment, each 10\%  increase in patients treated within the recommended time was associated with a  decrease in the region-level odds of overall 30-day mortality (OR, 0.80; 95\% CI,  0.65-0.98). CONCLUSION: Among patients in Quebec with STEMI, reperfusion  delivered outside guideline-recommend delays was associated with significantly  increased 30-day mortality, a statistically nonsignificant increase in 1-year  mortality, and significantly increased risk of the composite of mortality or  readmission for acute myocardial infarction or heart failure at 1 year.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction is associated with high in-hospital mortality attributable to persisting low-cardiac output. The Impella-EUROSHOCK-registry evaluates the safety and efficacy of the Impella-2.5-percutaneous left-ventricular assist device in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter registry retrospectively included 120 patients (63.6{\textpm}12.2 years; 81.7\% male) with cardiogenic shock from acute myocardial infarction receiving temporary circulatory support with the Impella-2.5-percutaneous left-ventricular assist device. The primary end point evaluated mortality at 30 days. The secondary end point analyzed the change of plasma lactate after the institution of hemodynamic support, and the rate of early major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events as well as long-term survival. Thirty-day mortality was 64.2\% in the study population. After Impella-2.5-percutaneous left-ventricular assist device implantation, lactate levels decreased from 5.8{\textpm}5.0 mmol/L to 4.7{\textpm}5.4 mmol/L (P=0.28) and 2.5{\textpm}2.6 mmol/L (P=0.023) at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Early major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events were reported in 18 (15\%) patients. Major bleeding at the vascular access site, hemolysis, and pericardial tamponade occurred in 34 (28.6\%), 9 (7.5\%), and 2 (1.7\%) patients, respectively. The parameters of age {$>$}65 and lactate level {$>$}3.8 mmol/L at admission were identified as predictors of 30-day mortality. After 317{\textpm}526 days of follow-up, survival was 28.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute cardiogenic shock from acute myocardial infarction, Impella 2.5-treatment is feasible and results in a reduction of lactate levels, suggesting improved organ perfusion. However, 30-day mortality remains high in these patients. This likely reflects the last-resort character of Impella-2.5-application in selected patients with a poor hemodynamic profile and a greater imminent risk of death. Carefully conducted randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of Impella-2.5-support in this high-risk patient group.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the type of anaesthesia used and the perception toward anaesthesia among cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, and nurses. Our objective was to describe the use of sedation during nonsurgical cardiac procedures. METHODS: We designed a Web-based survey to assess anaesthesia practices during cardiac procedures. The survey was distributed to cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, and nurses through national societies and international investigator networks. The questions addressed the type of practice, type of anaesthesia used during procedures, and perceptions regarding anaesthesia. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 497 participants. Sedation during cardiac catheterization was used by 77/84 (92\%) of cardiologists in North America, but only by 46/121 (38\%) in other countries (P~{$<$} 0.0001). Use of general anaesthesia for complex procedures such as transaortic valve replacement is also more common in North America (92\%) compared with other countries (76\%; P~= 0.004). Specific sedation-related training was provided to less than a third of nonanaesthesiologists. Although more than half of the nurses received training regarding procedural sedation, such training is provided to less than a quarter of the cardiologists. The lack of training was noted in all geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthesia and especially sedation is frequently used during percutaneous cardiac procedures. The rate of use and perceptions regarding sedation differs among professionals and might be influenced by culture, training, and geography. There is a lack of adequate formal training in the use of sedation and analgesia for nonanaesthesia professionals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains an underused tool for secondary prevention post-myocardial infarction (MI). In part, this arises  from uncertainty regarding the efficacy of CR, particularly with respect to  reinfarction, where previous studies have failed to show consistent benefit. We  therefore undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to (1)  estimate the effect of CR on cardiovascular outcomes and (2) examine the effect  of CR program characteristics on the magnitude of CR benefits. METHODS: We  systematically searched MEDLINE as well as relevant bibliographies to identify  all English-language RCTs examining the effects of exercise-based CR among  post-MI patients. Data were aggregated using random-effects models. Stratified  analyses were conducted to examine the impact of RCT-level characteristics on  treatment benefits. RESULTS: We identified 34 RCTs (N = 6,111). Overall, patients  randomized to exercise-based CR had a lower risk of reinfarction (odds ratio [OR]  0.53, 95\% CI 0.38-0.76), cardiac mortality (OR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.46-0.88), and  all-cause mortality (OR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.58-0.95). In stratified analyses,  treatment effects were consistent regardless of study periods, duration of CR, or  time beyond the active intervention. Exercise-based CR had favorable effects on  cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking, blood pressure, body weight, and  lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-based CR is associated with reductions in  mortality and reinfarction post-MI. Our secondary analyses suggest that even  shorter CR programs may translate into improved long-term outcomes, although  these results need to be confirmed in an RCT.},

These represent a promising device for  overcoming the well-known limitations of traditional metallic stents, which are  associated with a persistent yearly increased risk of adverse events. This  technology has the ability to homogeneously transfer the drug into the vessel  wall in the absence of a permanent prosthesis implanted in the coronary vessel.  Robust data support the use of DCB for the treatment of in-stent restenosis, but  there is also currently growing evidence from long-term follow-up of large  randomised clinical trials regarding the use of these devices in other scenarios,  such as de novo small and large vessel disease, complex bifurcations, and diffuse  coronary disease. Other critical clinical settings such as diabetes mellitus,  high bleeding risk patients and acute coronary syndromes could be approached in  the upcoming future by using DCB, alone or as part of a blended strategy in  combination with drug-eluting stents. There have been important scientific and  technical advances in the DCB field in recent years. The purpose of this paper is  to review the most current data regarding the use of DCB, including the mid- and  long-term follow-up reports on the safety and efficacy of this novel strategy in  different clinical and angiographic scenarios.},

As a result patients are at increased risk of respiratory infection. Initial management consists of sodium restriction, diuretics, and thoracentesis. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be required. Because most patients with hepatic hydrothorax have end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant should be considered if these options fail.},

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of quantitative flow ratio (QFR) in patients with angina and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify the conditions with low diagnostic performance. We assessed the QFR for 1077 vessels under fractional flow ratio (FFR) evaluation in 915 patients with angina and AMI. The diagnostic accuracies of the QFR for identifying an FFR\,{$\leq$}\,0.8 were 95.98\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 94.52 to 97.14\%) for the angina group and 92.42\% (95\% CI 86.51 to 96.31\%) for the AMI group. The diagnostic accuracy of the QFR in the borderline FFR zones ({$>$}\,0.75,\,{$\leq$}\,0.85) (91.23\% [95\% CI 88.25 to 93.66\%]) was significantly lower than that in others (difference: 4.32; p\,=\,0.001). The condition accompanying both AMI and the borderline FFR zone showed the lowest QFR diagnostic accuracy in our data (83.93\% [95\% CI 71.67 to 92.38]). The diagnostic accuracy was reduced for tandem lesions (p\,=\,0.04, not correcting for multiple testing). Our study found that the QFR method yielded a high overall diagnostic performance in real-world patients. However, low diagnostic accuracy has been observed in borderline FFR zones with AMI, and the hybrid FFR approach needs to be considered.}

In order to achieve a controlled and prolonged release of the  antiproliferative agent, current drug-eluting stents utilise various  biodegradable as well as non-erodible polymeric blends to coat the stent surface  and to serve as drug carriers. The utilisation of polymeric compounds in current  drug-eluting stents may eventually limit their performance as well as their  clinical applicability due to the potential induction of undesirable local  reactions. The development of alternative, polymer-free drug carriers has the  potential to overcome some of the limitations of current drug-eluting stent  formulations. Moreover, improvements in drug carriers may also result in an  expansion of the technological possibilities for other intravascular drug  delivery systems, such as metal-free or even implant-free solutions. This article  describes the structure and the preclinical validation profile of a novel  phospholipid encapsulated sirolimus nanocarrier, used as a coating in two  formulations: a coronary stent-plus-balloon system and a stand-alone balloon  catheter. The nanoparticles provided a stable, even and homogenous coating to the  devices in both formulations. Dose-finding studies allowed the most appropriate  identification of the best nanoparticle structure associated with an extremely  efficient transfer of drug to all layers of the vessel wall, achieving high  tissue concentrations that persisted days after the application, with low  systemic drug leaks.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Albumin-adjusted total calcium is often used as a surrogate marker for free calcium to evaluate hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia. Many adjustment formulas based on simple linear regression models have been published, and continue to be used in spite of questionable diagnostic accuracy. In the hope of finding a more pure albumin effect on total calcium, we used multiple linear regression models to adjust for other relevant variables. The regression coefficients of albumin were used to construct local adjustment formulas, and we tested whether the diagnostic accuracy was improved compared with previously published formulas and unadjusted calcium. DESIGN: A retrospective hospital laboratory data study. DATA SOURCES: The local hospital laboratory data system. SETTING: Norway, 2006-2015. PARTICIPANTS: 6549 patients above 2 years of age, where free calcium standardised at pH 7.40, total calcium, creatinine, albumin and phosphate had been analysed in a single blood draw, including hospitalised patients and patients from outpatient clinics and general practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy by Harrell's c and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, using free calcium standardised at pH 7.40 as a gold standard, in subgroups with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {$\geq$}60\,or {$<$}60\,mL/min/1.73\,m(2). RESULTS: In the subgroup with eGFR {$<$}60\,mL/min/1.73\,m(2), the Harrell's c of unadjusted total calcium (0.801) was significantly larger than those of the local formulas (0.790, p=0.002) and the best formula taken from literature (0.791, p=0.004). In the subgroup with eGFR {$\geq$}60\,mL/min/1.73\,m(2), no significant differences were found between these three formulas. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the diagnostic accuracy of unadjusted total calcium is superior to several commonly used adjustment formulas, and we suggest that the use of such formulas should be abandoned in clinical practice. If the clinician does not trust total calcium to reflect the calcium status of the patient, free calcium should be measured.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies investigated the implications of post-PCI QFR and post-PCI {$\Delta$}QFR (absolute increase of QFR) in de novo lesions of small coronary  disease after drug-coated balloon (DCB). OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the  prognostic implications of post-PCI QFR and post-PCI {$\Delta$}QFR in patients who  received DCB only. METHODS: Patients were divided according to the optimal cutoff  value of the post-PCI QFR and the post-PCI {$\Delta$}QFR. The primary outcome was major  adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including target vessel revascularization  (TVR), cardiac death, and myocardial infarction (MI). RESULTS: The optimal cutoff  values of QFR and {$\Delta$}QFR for the MACE rate were 0.86 and 0.57, respectively. There  were 175 patients (61.2\%) with a high QFR ({$\geq$}\,0.86) and 113 patients (39.5\%) with  a high {$\Delta$}QFR ({$\geq$}\,0.57) after PCI. The MACE rate was significantly higher in  patients with a low QFR compared to a high QFR (5.7\% vs. 27.0\%, hazard ratio  [HR]: 3.632, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.872 to 7.044, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The MACE  rate was higher in patients with a low {$\Delta$}QFR increase compared to those with high  {$\Delta$}QFR (4.4\% vs. 20.2\%, HR: 4.700, 95\%CI: 2.430 to 9.089, P\,=\,0.001). In  multivariable model, a low post-PCI QFR and a low post-PCI {$\Delta$}QFR was independent  predictor of MACE (adjusted HR: 4.071, 95\%CI: 2.037 to 8.135, P\,=\,0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: After DCB in de novo lesions of small coronary disease, both  post-PCI QFR and {$\Delta$}QFR showed similar prognostic implications in MACE.},

The purpose of the study is to identify risk factors associated with the incidence of VTA complicating AMI. A total of 200 patients with AMI who were admitted to our hospital from February 2018 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. These 200 patients were classified into a non-VTA group (n = 140) and a VTA group (n = 60) based on the occurrence of VTA within 24 after AMI. Patients in the VTA group were older than those in the non-VTA group. The VTA group had more numbers of WBCs and neutrophils than the non-VTA group. The level of serum potassium was lower, but the levels of cTnT and CK-MB were higher in the VTA group than in the non-VTA group. The VTA group presented an increase in proportions of anterior MI, TpTe, and proportions of Killip classification {$\geq$} class II but a decline in LVEF when comparable to the non-VTA group. The two groups were not significantly different concerning other variables including sex, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart rate, Scr, SUA, BUN, PTL counts, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, D-dimer, BNP, LVS, LVP, and LVEDd. The levels of hsCRP, endothelin-1, and TNF-{$\alpha$} were remarkably higher in the VTA group than in the non-VTA group (P {$<$} 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, with clinical variables including age, WBCs, neutrophils, serum potassium, cTnT, CK-MB, hsCRP, endothelin-1, TNF-{$\alpha$}, anterior MI, TpTe, proportions of Killip classification {$\geq$} class II, and LVEF as an independent variable and with the occurrence of VTA as a dependent variable. It was revealed that serum potassium, cTnT, CK-MB, hsCRP, endothelin-1, TpTe, proportions of Killip classification {$\geq$} class II, and LVEF were independent risk factors of VTA complicating AMI. Compared with the non-VTA group, the incidence rate of simple left heart failure, total heart failure, stroke, and dyslipidemia in the VTA group was significantly higher than those in the non-VTA group (P {$<$} 0.05). It was found that the proportion of all-cause deaths within one year outside the hospital was higher in the VAT group than in the non-VAT group (P {$<$} 0.05). Collectively, the study demonstrates serum potassium, cTnT, CK-MB, hsCRP, endothelin-1, TpTe, proportions of Killip classification {$\geq$} class II, and LVEF were independent risk factors of VTA complicating AMI.}

We analyze the performance of language models on two tasks that require identifying relevant information in their input contexts: multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval. We find that performance can degrade significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating that current language models do not robustly make use of information in long input contexts. In particular, we observe that performance is often highest when relevant information occurs at the beginning or end of the input context, and significantly degrades when models must access relevant information in the middle of long contexts, even for explicitly long-context models. Our analysis provides a better understanding of how language models use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future long-context language models.}

METHODS: Patients  participating in a previous randomized clinical trial for DCB-ISR were post-hoc  analyzed. The primary endpoint was vessel-oriented composite endpoint (VOCE),  defined as cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and  ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization. {$\mu$}QFRs at baseline and after DCB  angioplasty was calculated, and its prognostic value as a predictor of VOCE was  explored in Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 169 lesions in 169 patients were  analyzed. At 1-year follow-up, 20 VOCEs occurred in 20 patients.  Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis identified a post-procedural  {$\mu$}QFR of {$\leq$} 0.89 as the best cut-off to predict VOCE (area under curve [AUC]: 0.74;  95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.80; p {$<$} 0.001), superior to post-procedural  in-stent percent diameter stenosis, which reported an AUC of 0.61 (95\% CI:  0.53-0.68; p = 0.18). Post-procedural {$\mu$}QFR was significantly lower in patients  with VOCE compared with those without (0.88 [interquartile range: 0.79-0.94] vs.  0.96 [interquartile range: 0.91-0.98], respectively; p {$<$} 0.001). After correction  for potential confounders, post-procedural {$\mu$}QFR {$\leq$} 0.89 was associated with a  6-fold higher risk of VOCE than lesions with {$\mu$}QFR {$>$} 0.89 (hazard ratio: 5.94; 95\%  CI: 2.33-15.09; p {$<$} 0.001).

In terms of medical documentation, ChatGPT has proven effective in generating patient clinical letters, radiology reports, medical notes, and discharge summaries, improving efficiency and accuracy for health care providers. Future research directions include real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, precision medicine and personalized treatment, the role of ChatGPT in telemedicine and remote health care, and integration with existing health care systems. Overall, ChatGPT is a valuable tool that complements the expertise of health care providers and improves clinical decision-making and patient care. However, ChatGPT is a double-edged sword. We need to carefully consider and study the benefits and potential dangers of ChatGPT.

  abstract = {GPT-\$3\$ has attracted lots of attention due to its superior performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, especially with its powerful and versatile in-context few-shot learning ability. Despite its success, we found that the empirical results of GPT-\$3\$ depend heavily on the choice of in-context examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random sampling) that better leverage GPT-\$3\$'s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural network models, we propose to retrieve examples that are semantically-similar to a test sample to formulate its corresponding prompt. Intuitively, the in-context examples selected with such a strategy may serve as more informative inputs to unleash GPT-\$3\$'s extensive knowledge. We evaluate the proposed approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks, where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms the random baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results. Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text generation (41.9\% on the ToTTo dataset) and open-domain question answering (45.5\% on the NQ dataset). We hope our investigation could help understand the behaviors of GPT-\$3\$ and large-scale pre-trained LMs in general and enhance their few-shot capabilities.},

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included ISR patients who underwent DCB angioplasty under OCT guidance. The primary outcome of the study was a target vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, target vessel myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. During a median follow-up of 756 days (IQR: 443.25, 1134.50), 204 ISR patients underwent OCT-guided DCB angioplasty, resulting in TVF development in 27 patients. At the post-procedural DCB angioplasty, the vessel-level QFR was significantly lower in the TVF group (0.89 [IQR: 0.87, 0.93] vs. 0.93 [IQR: 0.91, 0.96]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001) than in the non-TVF group. Analysis of the qualitative characteristics of ISR lesions showed a significantly higher incidence of heterogeneous neointima in the TVF group compared with the non-TVF group (13 [48.15\%] vs. 32 [18.08\%]; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, low vessel-level QFR (HR per 0.1 increase: 0.11; 95\% CI: 0.03--0.41; P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and heterogeneous neointima were independently associated with TVF. The TVF rate of vessels with the 2 features was 10.69 times higher than that of all other vessels (95\%CI [2.05--55.79]; log-rank P\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Vessel-level QFR and heterogeneous neointima were independent factors associated with TVF in ISR patients after DCB angioplasty.

Although the development of HH remains incompletely understood, the most acceptable explanation is that the pleural effusion is a result of a direct passage of ascitic fluid into the pleural cavity through a defect in the diaphragm due to the raised abdominal pressure and the negative pressure within the pleural space. Patients with HH can be asymptomatic or present with pulmonary symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, hypoxemia, or respiratory failure associated with large pleural effusions. The diagnosis is established clinically by finding a serous transudate after exclusion of cardiopulmonary disease and is confirmed by radionuclide imaging demonstrating communication between the peritoneal and pleural spaces when necessary. Spontaneous bacterial empyema is serious complication of HH, which manifest by increased pleural fluid neutrophils or a positive bacterial culture and will require antibiotic therapy. The mainstay of therapy of HH is sodium restriction and administration of diuretics. When medical therapy fails, the only definitive treatment is liver transplantation. Therapeutic thoracentesis, indwelling tunneled pleural catheters, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and thoracoscopic repair of diaphragmatic defects with pleural sclerosis can provide symptomatic relief, but the morbidity and mortality is high in these extremely ill patients.},

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT in experiments on translating radiology reports into plain language for patients and healthcare providers so that they are educated for improved healthcare. Radiology reports from 62 low-dose chest computed tomography lung cancer screening scans and 76 brain magnetic resonance imaging metastases screening scans were collected in the first half of February for this study. According to the evaluation by radiologists, ChatGPT can successfully translate radiology reports into plain language with an average score of 4.27 in the five-point system with 0.08 places of information missing and 0.07 places of misinformation. In terms of the suggestions provided by ChatGPT, they are generally relevant such as keeping following-up with doctors and closely monitoring any symptoms, and for about 37\% of 138 cases in total ChatGPT offers specific suggestions based on findings in the report. ChatGPT also presents some randomness in its responses with occasionally over-simplified or neglected information, which can be mitigated using a more detailed prompt. Furthermore, ChatGPT results are compared with a newly released large model GPT-4, showing that GPT-4 can significantly improve the quality of translated reports. Our results show that it is feasible to utilize large language models in clinical education, and further efforts are needed to address limitations and maximize their potential.}

METHODS: A nationwide registry-based  cohort study of patients undergoing emergency surgery for perforated ulcer. We  used data from the Danish Prehospital Database 2016-2017 and the Danish Emergency  Surgery Registry 2004-2018 combined with data from other Danish databases.  Patients were categorized according to severity of mental health history.  RESULTS: We identified 4.767 patients undergoing emergency surgery for perforated  ulcer. Among patients calling the EMS with no history of mental illness, 51\% were  identified with abdominal pain when calling the EMS compared to 31\% and 25\% among  patients with a history of moderate and major mental illness, respectively.  Median time from hospital arrival to surgery was 6.0~h (IQR: 3.6;10.7). Adjusting  for age, sex and comorbidity, patients with a history of major mental illness  underwent surgery 46~min (95\% CI: 4;88) later compared to patients with no  history of mental illness. Median number of days-alive-and-out-of-hospital at  90-day follow-up was 67~days (IQR: 0;83). Adjusting for age, sex and comorbidity,  patients with a history of major mental illness had 9~days (95\% CI: 4;14) less  alive and out-of-hospital at 90-day follow-up. CONCLUSION: One-third of the  population had a history of mental illness or vulnerability. Patients with a  history of major mental illness were less likely to be identified with abdominal  pain if calling the EMS prior to arrival. They had longer delays from hospital  arrival to surgery and higher mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of stent-related major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are believed to occur  within the first year. Very-late ({$>$}1-year) stent-related MACE have not been well  described. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and  predictors of very-late stent-related events or MACE by stent type. METHODS:  Individual patient data from 19 prospective, randomized metallic stent trials  maintained at a leading academic research organization were pooled. Very-late  MACE (a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction [MI], or  ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [ID-TLR]), and target lesion  failure (cardiac death, target-vessel MI, or ID-TLR) were assessed within year 1  and between 1 and 5 years after PCI with bare-metal stents (BMS),  first-generation drug-eluting stents (DES1) and second-generation drug-eluting  stents (DES2). A network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate direct and  indirect comparisons. RESULTS: Among 25,032 total patients, 3,718, 7,934, and  13,380 were treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively. MACE rates within 1  year after PCI were progressively lower after treatment with BMS versus DES1  versus DES2 (17.9\%~vs. 8.2\% vs. 5.1\%, respectively, p~{$<~$}0.0001). Between years 1  and 5, very-late MACE occurred in 9.4\% of patients (including 2.9\% cardiac death,  3.1\% MI, and 5.1\% ID-TLR). Very-late MACE occurred in 9.7\%, 11.0\%, and 8.3\% of  patients treated with BMS, DES1, and DES2, respectively (p~{$<~$}0.0001), linearly  increasing between 1 and 5 years. Similar findings were observed for target  lesion failure in 19,578 patients from 12 trials. Findings were confirmed in the  network meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale, individual patient data  pooled study, very-late stent-related events occurred between 1 and 5 years after  PCI at a rate of {$\sim$}2\%/year with all stent types, with no plateau evident. New  approaches are~required to improve long-term outcomes after PCI.},

Open-source (OS) medical LLMs show performance improvements and provide the transparency and compliance required in healthcare. We present OpenMedLM, a prompting platform delivering state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for OS LLMs on medical benchmarks. We evaluated OS foundation LLMs (7B-70B) on medical benchmarks (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU medical-subset) and selected Yi34B for developing OpenMedLM. Prompting strategies included zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and ensemble/self-consistency voting. OpenMedLM delivered OS SOTA results on three medical LLM benchmarks, surpassing previous best-performing OS models that leveraged costly and extensive fine-tuning. OpenMedLM displays the first results to date demonstrating the ability of OS foundation models to optimize performance, absent specialized fine-tuning. The model achieved 72.6\% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming the previous SOTA by 2.4\%, and 81.7\% accuracy on MMLU medical-subset, establishing itself as the first OS LLM to surpass 80\% accuracy on this benchmark. Our results highlight medical-specific emergent properties in OS LLMs not documented elsewhere to date and validate the ability of OS models to accomplish healthcare tasks, highlighting the benefits of prompt engineering to improve performance of accessible LLMs for medical applications.},

Discussing various studies in the didactics of mathematics related to ethical-moral issues, we present an approach inspired by the writings of Levinas, along with our recent work on the epistemology of mathematical activity. This perspective invites us to see mathematics teaching as an opportunity to experience otherness, in which sensitivity to working together develops. Thus, from the point of view of math activities, we explore the themes of otherness, responsibility and the ethical impossibility of knowledge at the heart of Levinas' work. We then highlight some challenges and possibilities for a teamwork ethic in mathematics education.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Two identical, concurrent, parallel, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials were conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid and pamidronate for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe HCM (corrected serum calcium [CSC] {$>$} or = 3.00 mmol/L [12.0 mg/dL]) were treated with a single dose of zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg) via 5-minute infusion or pamidronate (90 mg) via 2-hour infusion. A protocol-specified pooled analysis of the two parallel trials was performed. Clinical end points included rate of complete response by day 10, response duration, and time to relapse. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-seven patients were randomized and evaluated for safety; 275 were evaluated for efficacy. Both doses of zoledronic acid were superior to pamidronate in the treatment of HCM. The complete response rates by day 10 were 88.4\% (P = .002), 86.7\% (P = .015), and 69.7\% for zoledronic acid 4 mg and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg, respectively. Normalization of CSC occurred by day 4 in approximately 50\% of patients treated with zoledronic acid and in only 33.3\% of the pamidronate-treated patients. The median duration of complete response favored zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg over pamidronate 90 mg with response durations of 32, 43, and 18 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Zoledronic acid is superior to pamidronate; 4 mg is the dose recommended for initial treatment of HCM and 8 mg for relapsed or refractory hypercalcemia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance to facilitate stent implantation has been demonstrated to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), predominantly due to a reduction in target lesion revascularization (TLR). The objectives of our meta-analysis are to assess the effect of IVUS on clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality. METHODS: RCTs comparing drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation using IVUS plus angiography versus angiography alone were identified from a comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library. Pooled relative risks (RR) were obtained using DerSimonian and Laird estimator for the random effects model. RESULTS: The search yielded 10 RCTs (5007 participants) in which the relevant data were available. Two trials were performed in patients with chronic total occlusion (CTO), whereas other trials included patients that either had stable ischemic heart disease (22-64\%) or presented as an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (36-78\%). Routine use of IVUS was effective in reducing TLR (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.44, 0.80; p\,{$<$}\,0.01), target vessel revascularization (TVR) (RR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.43, 0.81; p\,{$<$}\,0.01), and MACE (RR 0.63, 95\% CI 0.51, 0.77; p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Cardiovascular mortality was also significantly reduced (RR 0.51, 95\% CI 0.27, 0.96; p\,=\,0.04). CONCLUSION: During DES implantation, the routine use of IVUS in addition to angiography improves clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality. These findings reinforce the need for a broader implementation of IVUS-guidance during PCI. Since a significant proportion of patients studied presented as ACS, future trials should assess the benefit of IVUS-guidance in a more focused presentation setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are an established treatment strategy for coronary artery disease. Randomized data on the application of DCBs in patients  with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are limited. We evaluated the impact of  clinical presentation (ACS versus chronic coronary syndrome) on clinical outcomes  in patients undergoing DCB or drug-eluting stent (DES) treatment in a  prespecified analysis of the BASKET-SMALL 2 trial (Basel Kosten Effektivit{\"a}ts  Trial-Drug-Coated Balloons Versus Drug-Eluting Stents in Small Vessel  Interventions). METHODS: BASKET-SMALL 2 randomized 758 patients with small vessel  coronary artery disease to DCB or DES treatment and followed them for 3 years  regarding major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial  infarction, and target vessel revascularization). RESULTS: Among 758 patients,  214 patients (28.2\%) presented with an ACS (15 patients [7\%],  ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction; 109 patients [50.9\%],  non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction; 90 patients [42.1\%], unstable  angina pectoris). At 1-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in the  incidence of the primary end point by randomized treatment in patients with ACS  (hazard ratio, 0.50 [95\% CI, 0.19-1.26] for DCB versus DES) or chronic coronary  syndrome (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95\% CI, 0.67-2.47] for DCB versus DES). There was  no significant interaction between clinical presentation and treatment effect (P  for interaction, 0.088). For cardiac death (P for interaction, 0.049) and  nonfatal myocardial infarction (P for interaction, 0.010), a significant  interaction between clinical presentation and treatment was seen at 1 year with  lower rates of these secondary end points in patients with ACS treated by DCB. At  3 years, there were similar major adverse cardiac event rates throughout groups  without significant interaction between clinical presentation and treatment (P  for interaction, 0.301). All-cause mortality was higher in ACS compared with  chronic coronary syndrome; however, there was no difference between DCB and DES  irrespective of clinical presentation. CONCLUSIONS: In this subgroup analysis of  the BASKET-SMALL 2 trial, there was no interaction between indication for  percutaneous coronary intervention (acute versus chronic coronary syndrome) and  treatment effect of DCB versus DES in patients with small vessel coronary artery  disease.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate feasibility and technical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who have undergone high-risk procedures with continuous flow left ventricular (LV) assist, with the Impella 2.5 system (Abiomed, Danvers, MA). BACKGROUND: In preparation for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, an increasing number of high-risk patients with severe AS and left ventricular dysfunction are currently considered for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Hemodynamic support may be required in some patients. METHODS: We reviewed procedural and clinical findings and 30-day outcomes in patients with symptomatic AS who underwent high-risk percutaneous procedures supported by the Impella 2.5 system. All patients carried a high-risk of operative mortality. Impella was used during PCI, BAV, and for hemodynamic support during emergencies. RESULTS: Over a 14-month period, 21 patients with AS underwent insertion of Impella prior to high-risk PCI (n = 3), BAV with subsequent PCI (n = 8), BAV alone (n = 7), or during cardiac arrest immediately following BAV (n = 3). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted mortality risk was 14\% (range 7.3-24.7\%). Impella was inserted successfully in all patients attempted. Retrograde advancement of two catheters across the aortic valve (for concomitant BAV in 15 patients) was technically feasible. Retrograde continuous flow LV assist produced a reduction in LV end-diastolic pressure and an increase in arterial pressure. Periprocedural complications occurred in 19\% (n = 4) patients, with no periprocedural deaths. Mortality at 30 days was 14.2\%. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that continuous flow LV assist with Impella 2.5 can be used in high-risk patients with severe AS who require periprocedural hemodynamic support.},

Despite  the introduction of new generation drug-eluting stents, their efficacy in the  diabetics is still limited. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of the Abluminus DES+  biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent in reducing neointimal hyperplasia  in diabetic patients, compared to a durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent  (DP-EES). METHODS: A total of 131 patients with diabetes and coronary artery  disease were enrolled in six Italian centers and randomized in a 2:1 fashion to  PCI with Abluminus DES+ or DP-EES: 85 were assigned to Abluminus DES+ and 46 to  DP-EES. The primary endpoint was optimal coherence tomography (OCT)-derived  neointimal volume at 9-12 months. Secondary endpoints included OCT-derived  neointimal area, neointimal volume obstruction and adverse clinical events.  RESULTS: The primary endpoint, neointimal volume, did not differ between  Abluminus DES+ and DP-EES (29.11\,{\textpm}\,18.90\,mm(3) vs. 25.48\,{\textpm}\,17.04\,mm(3) ,  p\,=\,0.40) at 9-12-month follow-up. This finding remained consistent after  weighing for the sum of stents lengths (1.14\,{\textpm}\,0.68\,mm(3) vs. 0.99\,{\textpm}\,0.74\,mm(3)  for Abluminus DES+ and DP-EES, respectively, p\,=\,0.38). Similarly, other  OCT-derived and clinical secondary endpoints did not significantly differ between  the two groups. Rate of target lesion failure was high in both groups (21.2\% for  Abluminus DES+ and 19.6\% for DP-EES). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study failed  to demonstrate the superiority of the Abluminus DES+ over the DP-EES in diabetic  patients in terms of neointimal proliferation.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high resolution imaging modality and has been considered as the ideal tool for the evaluation of neointimal tissue and  vascular responses following stent implantation. However, vascular response  profiles following the implantation of a novel nano polymer-free  sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) assessed by OCT has not been fully investigated.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a nano  polymer-free SES on neointimal formation using OCT. A total of 16 nano  polymer-free SESs were implanted in the coronary arteries of 8 pigs. At 3 (n=4)  or 6 months (n=4), the animals were euthanized following OCT evaluation and the  stented arterial segments were analyzed by histological analysis. Neointimal  area, thickness and burden were evaluated by OCT. In addition, strut-associated  inflammation, stent endothelialization and arterial injury were investigated by  histomorphological analysis. OCT examination showed that at 6 months, neointimal  thickness (193.3{\textpm}109.5 vs. 167.2{\textpm}119.7 {\textmu}m, P=0.023) and neointimal burden  (29.3{\textpm}14.3 vs. 24.8{\textpm}17.4\%, P=0.006) significantly increased compared with at 3  months. Histomorphological analysis indicated that the endothelialization score  was significantly greater at 6 months compared with at 3 months (2.85{\textpm}0.36 vs.  2.52{\textpm}0.60, P{$<$}0.001). However, at 3 months, nano polymer-free SES showed a  significantly higher inflammatory score [0 (0, 1) vs. 0 (0, 0), P{$<$}0.001] compared  with at 6 months. In conclusion, nano polymer-free SES achieves  endothelialization at 3 months; however, neointimal proliferation is more  significant at 6 months and may be attributed to strut-associated inflammation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) patients may have different characteristics and outcomes when compared with type 1 MI. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare patients with type 1 MI to those with type 2 MI in the United States. METHODS: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, MI patients were categorized over the 3~months following the introduction of an International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision code specific for type 2 MI. Baseline characteristics and inpatient and post-discharge outcomes among both cohorts were compared. RESULTS: There were 216,657 patients with type 1 MI, 37,765 patients with type 2 MI, and 1,525 patients with both type 1 and 2 MI. Patients with type 2 MI were older (71 years vs. 69 years; p~{$<~$}0.001), were more likely to be women (47.3\% vs. 40\%; p~{$<~$}0.001), and had higher prevalence of heart failure (27.9\% vs. 10.9\%; p~{$<~$}0.001), kidney disease (35.7\% vs. 25.7\%; p~{$<~$}0.001), and atrial fibrillation (31\% vs. 21\%; p~{$<~$}0.001). Rates of coronary angiography (10.9\% vs. 57.3\%; p~{$<~$}0.001), percutaneous coronary intervention (1.7\% vs. 38.5\%; p~{$<~$}0.001), and coronary artery bypass grafting (0.4\% vs. 7.8\%; p~{$<~$}0.001) were lower among type 2 MI patients. Patients with type 2 MI had lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 0.57 [95\% confidence interval: 0.54 to 0.60]) and 30-day MI readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.46 [95\% confidence interval: 0.35 to 0.59]). There was no difference in risk of 30-day all-cause or heart failure readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 MI have a unique cardiovascular phenotype when compared with type 1 MI, and are managed in a heterogenous manner. Validated management strategies for type 2 MI are needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effect of door-to-balloon time on mortality for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)  undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Studies  have found conflicting results regarding this relationship. METHODS: We conducted  a cohort study of 29,222 STEMI patients treated with PCI within 6 h of  presentation at 395 hospitals that participated in the National Registry of  Myocardial Infarction (NRMI)-3 and -4 from 1999 to 2002. We used hierarchical  models to evaluate the effect of door-to-balloon time on in-hospital mortality  adjusted for patient characteristics in the entire cohort and in different  subgroups of patients based on symptom onset-to-door time and baseline risk  status. RESULTS: Longer door-to-balloon time was associated with increased  in-hospital mortality (mortality rate of 3.0\%, 4.2\%, 5.7\%, and 7.4\% for  door-to-balloon times of {$<$} or =90 min, 91 to 120 min, 121 to 150 min, and {$>$}150  min, respectively; p for trend {$<$}0.01). Adjusted for patient characteristics,  patients with door-to-balloon time {$>$}90 min had increased mortality (odds ratio  1.42; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 1.62) compared with those who had  door-to-balloon time {$<$} or =90 min. In subgroup analyses, increasing mortality  with increasing door-to-balloon time was seen regardless of symptom onset-to-door  time ({$<$} or =1 h, {$>$}1 to 2 h, {$>$}2 h) and regardless of the presence or absence of  high-risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Time to primary PCI is strongly associated with  mortality risk and is important regardless of time from symptom onset to  presentation and regardless of baseline risk of mortality. Efforts to shorten  door-to-balloon time should apply to all patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monotherapy with a P2Y(12) inhibitor after a minimum period of dual antiplatelet therapy is an emerging approach to reduce the risk of bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: In a double-blind trial, we examined the effect of ticagrelor alone as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin with regard to clinically relevant bleeding among patients who were at high risk for bleeding or an ischemic event and had undergone PCI. After 3 months of treatment with ticagrelor plus aspirin, patients who had not had a major bleeding event or ischemic event continued to take ticagrelor and were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or placebo for 1 year. The primary end point was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. We also evaluated the composite end point of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, using a noninferiority hypothesis with an absolute margin of 1.6 percentage points. RESULTS: We enrolled 9006 patients, and 7119 underwent randomization after 3 months. Between randomization and 1 year, the incidence of the primary end point was 4.0\% among patients randomly assigned to receive ticagrelor plus placebo and 7.1\% among patients assigned to receive ticagrelor plus aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.68; P{$<$}0.001). The difference in risk between the groups was similar for BARC type 3 or 5 bleeding (incidence, 1.0\% among patients receiving ticagrelor plus placebo and 2.0\% among patients receiving ticagrelor plus aspirin; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.33 to 0.74). The incidence of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was 3.9\% in both groups (difference, -0.06 percentage points; 95\% CI, -0.97 to 0.84; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.78 to 1.25; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk patients who underwent PCI and completed 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy, ticagrelor monotherapy was associated with a lower incidence of clinically relevant bleeding than ticagrelor plus aspirin, with no higher risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

The CRUSADE Initiative is a nonrandomized, retrospective, observational registry enrolling patients with NSTE ACS to evaluate acute medications and interventions, inhospital outcomes, and discharge treatments. METHODS: The study population comprised patients presenting with NSTE ACS at 443 hospitals across the United States from January 2001 through June 2003 (n = 57,039). Outcomes were evaluated in patients receiving morphine versus not and between patients treated with morphine versus intravenous nitroglycerin. RESULTS: A total of 17,003 patients (29.8\%) received morphine within 24 hours of presentation. Patients treated with any morphine had a higher adjusted risk of death (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95\% CI 1.33-1.64) than patients not treated with morphine. Relative to those receiving nitroglycerin, patients treated with morphine also had a higher adjusted likelihood of death (OR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.26-1.78). Utilizing a propensity score matching method, the use of morphine was associated with increased inhospital mortality (OR 1.41, 95\% CI 1.26-1.57). The increased risk of death in patients receiving morphine persisted across all measured subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of morphine either alone or in combination with nitroglycerin for patients presenting with NSTE ACS was associated with higher mortality even after risk adjustment and matching on propensity score for treatment. This analysis raises concerns regarding the safety of using morphine in patients with NSTE ACS and emphasizes the need for a randomized trial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) by paramedics can decrease door-to-balloon times. While many paramedics are trained  to obtain and interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs), it is unknown how accurately  they can identify STEMIs. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated paramedics' accuracy in  recognizing STEMI on ECGs when faced with potential STEMI mimics. METHODS: This  was a descriptive cohort study using a survey administered to paramedics. The  survey contained questions about training, experience, and confidence, along with  10 ECGs: three demonstrating STEMIs (inferior, anterior, and lateral), two with  normal results, and five STEMI mimics (left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH],  ventricular pacing, left and right bundle branch blocks [LBBB, RBBB], and  supraventricular tachycardia [SVT]). We calculated the overall sensitivity and  specificity and the proportion correct with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).  RESULTS: We obtained 472 surveys from 30 municipal emergency medical services  (EMS) agencies in five counties with 15 medical directors from seven hospitals.  The majority (69\%) reported ECG training within the preceding year, 31\% within  six months; and 74\% were confident in recognizing STEMIs. The overall sensitivity  and specificity for STEMI detection were 75\% and 53\% (95\% CI 73\%-77\%, 51\%-55\%),  respectively. Ninety-six percent (453/472, 95\% CI 94\%-98\%) correctly identified  the inferior myocardial infarction (MI), but only 78\% (368/472, 94\% CI 74\%-82\%)  identified the anterior MI and 51\% (241/472, 46\%-56\%) the lateral MI.  Thirty-seven percent (173/472, 95\% CI 32\%-41\%) of the paramedics correctly  recognized LVH, 39\% (184/472, 95\% CI 35\%-44\%) LBBB, and 53\% (249/472, 95\% CI  48\%-57\%) ventricular pacing as not a STEMI. Thirty-nine percent (185/472, 95\% CI  35\%-44\%) correctly identified all three STEMIs; however, only 3\% of the  paramedics were correct in all interpretations. The two normal ECGs were  recognized as not a STEMI by 97\% (459/472, 95\% CI 95\%-99\%) and 100\% (472/472, 95\%  CI 99\%-100\%). There was no correlation between training, experience, or  confidence and accuracy in recognizing STEMIs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite training and  a high level of confidence, the paramedics in our study were only able to  identify an inferior STEMI and two normal ECGs. Given the paramedics' low  sensitivity and specificity, we cannot rely solely on their ECG interpretation to  activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Future research should involve  the evaluation of training programs that include assessment, initial training,  testing, feedback, and repeat training.},

Door-to-balloon time has become a performance measure and is the focus of  regional and national quality-improvement initiatives. However, it is not known  whether national improvements in door-to-balloon times have been accompanied by a  decline in mortality. METHODS: We analyzed annual trends in door-to-balloon times  and in-hospital mortality using data from 96,738 admissions for patients  undergoing primary PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from July  2005 through June 2009 at 515 hospitals participating in the CathPCI Registry. In  a subgroup analysis using a linked Medicare data set, we assessed 30-day  mortality. RESULTS: Median door-to-balloon times declined significantly, from 83  minutes in the 12 months from July 2005 through June 2006 to 67 minutes in the 12  months from July 2008 through June 2009 (P{$<$}0.001). Similarly, the percentage of  patients for whom the door-to-balloon time was 90 minutes or less increased from  59.7\% in the first year to 83.1\% in the last year (P{$<$}0.001). Despite improvements  in door-to-balloon times, there was no significant overall change in unadjusted  in-hospital mortality (4.8\% in 2005-2006 and 4.7\% in 2008-2009, P=0.43 for trend)  or in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (5.0\% in 2005-2006 and 4.7\% in  2008-2009, P=0.34), nor was a significant difference observed in unadjusted  30-day mortality (P=0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Although national door-to-balloon times  have improved significantly for patients undergoing primary PCI for ST-segment  elevation myocardial infarction, in-hospital mortality has remained virtually  unchanged. These data suggest that additional strategies are needed to reduce  in-hospital mortality in this population.

Data were extracted from electronic medical records, excluding diagnostic test results, and used to assess the models and human experts in a double-blind setup. The models' performances were evaluated based on their accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in diagnosing Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).Findings ``Lingyi Zhihui'' demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy of 76.40\%, sensitivity of 90.99\%, and specificity of 70.15\%. ``Tongyi Qianwen'' showed an accuracy of 61.11\%, sensitivity of 91.67\%, and specificity of 47.95\%. MediGuide-14B outperformed these models with an accuracy of 84.52\%, showcasing high sensitivity and commendable specificity. Human experts achieved higher accuracy (86.37\%) and specificity (89.26\%) but lower sensitivity compared to the LLMs. The study also highlighted the potential of LLMs to provide rapid triage decisions, significantly faster than human experts, though with varying degrees of reliability and completeness in their recommendations.Interpretation The study confirms the potential of LLMs in enhancing emergency medical diagnostics, particularly in settings with limited resources. MediGuide-14B, with its tailored training for medical applications, demonstrates considerable promise for clinical integration. However, the variability in performance underscores the need for further fine-tuning and contextual adaptation to improve reliability and efficacy in medical applications. Future research should focus on optimizing LLMs for specific medical tasks and integrating them with conventional medical systems to leverage their full potential in real-world settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementIn the design of the study; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the decision to submit the paper for publication, the study sponsors had no involvement.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the safety of drug-coated balloon (DCB)-only angioplasty compared to drug-eluting stent (DES), as part of routine clinical  practice. BACKGROUND: The recent BASKETSMALL2 trial demonstrated the safety and  efficacy of DCB angioplasty for de novo small vessel disease. Registry data have  also demonstrated that DCB angioplasty is safe; however, most of these studies  are limited due to long recruitment time and a small number of patients with DCB  compared to DES. Therefore, it is unclear if DCB-only strategy is safe to  incorporate in routine elective clinical practice. METHODS: We compared all-cause  mortality and major cardiovascular endpoints (MACE), including unplanned target  lesion revascularisation (TLR) of all patients treated with DCB or DES for first  presentation of stable angina due to de novo coronary artery disease between 1st  January 2015 and 15th November 2019. Data were analysed with Cox regression  models and cumulative hazard plots. RESULTS: We present 1237 patients; 544  treated with DCB and 693 treated with DES for de novo, mainly large-vessel  coronary artery disease. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, only age and  frailty remained significant adverse predictors of all-cause mortality.  Univariable, cumulative hazard plots showed no difference between DCB and DES for  either all-cause mortality or any of the major cardiovascular endpoints,  including unplanned TLR. The results remained unchanged following propensity  score-matched analysis. CONCLUSION: DCB-only angioplasty, for stable angina and  predominantly large vessels, is safe compared to DES as part of routine clinical  practice, in terms of all-cause mortality and MACE, including unplanned TLR.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In Switzerland there is a shortage of population-based information on heart failure (HF) incidence and case fatalities (CF). The aim of this study was to estimate HF event rates and both in- and out-of-hospital CF rates. METHODS: Data on HF diagnoses coded according to I 50 (ICD 10) were taken from the Federal Hospital Statistics Database and the Cause of Death Database for the year 2005. RESULTS: Although the total estimated number of HF events was higher for women (n = 4,201) than for men (n = 3,819), men showed higher numbers up to age group 65-74. Looking at age-specific HF cases per 100,000 population, men had higher rates in all age groups. The latter is also true of the age-standardised HF event rate (82.9/100,000 versus 51.4/100,000 population). Overall, CF was 26.3\% and higher for women (32.2\%) than for men (19.8\%). The same is true of out-of-hospital CF but not of in-hospital CF. CONCLUSION: The HF event rate was 20\% higher than the HF hospital discharge rate. Out-of-hospital death from HF accounted for the largest proportion of total HF deaths. Sex differences in both the number of HF events and HF event rates can be explained by the larger number of women than men aged 55+ in the Swiss population.},

METHOD: In this  cross-sectional study, we estimated and compared the Framingham 30-year CVD risk  score and individual modifiable CVD risk factors in young adult (20-39 years)  primary care patients with and without SMI at two US healthcare systems (January  2016-Septemeber 2018). Interaction terms assessed whether the SMI-risk  association differed across demographic groups. RESULTS: Covariate-adjusted  30-year CVD risk was significantly higher for those with (n=4228) versus those  without (n=155,363) SMI (RR 1.28, 95\% CI [1.26, 1.30]). Patients with SMI had  higher rates of hypertension (OR 2.02 [1.7, 2.39]), diabetes (OR 3.14 [2.59,  3.82]), obesity (OR 1.93 [1.8, 2.07]), and smoking (OR 4.94 [4.6, 5.36]). The  increased 30-year CVD risk associated with SMI varied significantly by race and  sex: there was an 8\% higher risk in Black compared to White patients (RR 1.08,  [1.04, 1.12]) and a 9\% lower risk in men compared to women (RR 0.91 [0.88,  0.94]). CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with SMI are at increased 30-year risk of CVD,  and further disparities exist for Black individuals and women.},

  abstract = {Although it is the tool used by most interventional cardiologists to assess the severity of coronary artery disease and guide treatment, coronary angiography has many limitations because it is a shadowgraph, depicting planar projections of the contrast-filled lumen that are often foreshortened rather than imaging the diseased vessel itself. Currently available intravascular imaging technologies include grayscale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), optical coherence tomography (OCT) (the light analogue of IVUS), and near-infrared spectroscopy that detects lipid within the vessel wall and that has been combined with grayscale IVUS in a single catheter as the first combined imaging device. They provide tomographic or cross-sectional images of the coronary arteries that include the lumen, vessel wall, plaque burden, plaque composition and distribution, and even peri-vascular structures-information promised, but rarely provided angiographically. Extensive literature shows that these tools can be used to answer questions that occur during daily practice as well as improving patient outcomes. Is this stenosis significant? Where is the culprit lesion? What is the anatomy of an unusual or~ambiguous angiographic lesion? What is the right stent size and length? What is the likelihood of distal embolization or~periprocedural myocardial infarction during stent implantation? Has the intervention been optimized? Why did this stent thrombose or restenose? This review summarizes these uses of intravascular imaging as well as the outcomes data~supporting their incorporation into routine clinical practice.},

Although the development of  high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays has improved the rule-in and rule-out  and risk stratification of acute MI without ST elevation, the immediate  management of the subset of acute MI with acute coronary occlusion depends on  integrating clinical presentation and ECG findings. Careful interpretation of the  ECG might yield subtle features suggestive of ischemia that might facilitate more  rapid triage of patients with subtle acute coronary occlusion or, conversely, in  identification of ST-elevation MI mimics (pseudo ST-elevation MI patterns). Our  goal in this review article is to consider recent advances in the use of the ECG  to diagnose coronary occlusion MIs, including the application of rules that allow  MI to be diagnosed on the basis of atypical ECG manifestations. Such rules  include the modified Sgarbossa criteria allowing identification of acute MI in  left bundle branch block or ventricular pacing, the 3- and 4-variable formula to  differentiate normal ST elevation (formerly called early repolarization) from  subtle ECG signs of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, the  differentiation of ST elevation of left ventricular aneurysm from that of acute  anterior MI, and the use of lead aVL in the recognition of inferior MI. Improved  use of the ECG is essential to improving the diagnosis and appropriate early  management of acute coronary occlusion MIs, which will lead to improved outcomes  for patients who present with acute coronary syndrome.},

Hypercalcemia of malignancy usually presents with markedly elevated calcium levels and therefore, usually severely symptomatic. Several major mechanisms are responsible for the development of hypercalcemia of malignancy including parathyroid hormone-related peptide-mediated humoral hypercalcemia, osteolytic metastases-related hypercalcemia, 1,25 Vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia, and parathyroid hormone-mediated hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma and extra parathyroid cancers. Diagnosis should include the history and physical examination as well as measurement of the above mediators of hypercalcemia. Management includes hydration, calcitonin, bisphosphonates, denosumab, and in certain patients, prednisone and cinacalcet. Patients with advanced underlying kidney disease and refractory severe hypercalcemia should be considered for hemodialysis. Hematology or oncology and palliative care specialists should be involved early to guide the options of cancer targeted therapies and help the patients and their closed ones with the discussion of comfort-oriented care.},

BACKGROUND: The ATLANTIC trial in patients with ongoing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction showed that pre-hospital ticagrelor was safe but did not improve pre-PCI coronary reperfusion compared with in-hospital ticagrelor. We hypothesized that the effect of pre-hospital ticagrelor may not have manifested until after PCI due to the rapid transfer time (31 min). METHODS: The ATLANTIC-H(24) analysis included 1,629 patients who underwent PCI, evaluating platelet reactivity, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3, {$\geq$} 70\% ST-segment elevation resolution, and clinical endpoints over the first 24 h. RESULTS: Following PCI, largest between-group differences in platelet reactivity occurred at 1 to 6 h; coronary reperfusion rates numerically favored pre-hospital ticagrelor, and the degree of ST-segment elevation resolution was significantly greater in the pre-hospital group (median, 75.0\% vs. 71.4\%; p = 0.049). At 24 h, the composite ischemic endpoint was lower with pre-hospital ticagrelor (10.4\% vs. 13.7\%; p = 0.039), as were individual endpoints of definite stent thrombosis (p = 0.0078) and myocardial infarction (p = 0.031). All endpoints except death (1.1\% vs. 0.2\%; p = 0.048) favored pre-hospital ticagrelor, with no differences in bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of pre-hospital ticagrelor became apparent after PCI, with numerical differences in platelet reactivity and immediate post-PCI reperfusion, associated with reductions in ischemic endpoints, over the first 24 h, whereas there was a small excess of mortality.

  abstract = {The exceptionally rapid development of highly flexible, reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models is likely to usher in newfound capabilities in medicine. We propose a new paradigm for medical AI, which we refer to as generalist medical AI (GMAI). GMAI models will be capable of carrying out a diverse set of tasks using very little or no task-specific labelled data. Built through self-supervision on large, diverse datasets, GMAI will flexibly interpret different combinations of medical modalities, including data from imaging, electronic health records, laboratory results, genomics, graphs or medical text. Models will in turn produce expressive outputs such as free-text explanations, spoken recommendations or image annotations that demonstrate advanced medical reasoning abilities. Here we identify a set of high-impact potential applications for GMAI and lay out specific technical capabilities and training datasets necessary to enable them. We expect that GMAI-enabled applications will challenge current strategies for regulating and validating AI devices for medicine and will shift practices associated with the collection of large medical datasets.},

Because  sirolimus (rapamycin) inhibits the proliferation of lymphocytes and smooth-muscle  cells, we compared a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard uncoated stent in  patients with angina pectoris. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind  trial to compare the two types of stents for revascularization of single, primary  lesions in native coronary arteries. The trial included 238 patients at 19  medical centers. The primary end point was in-stent late luminal loss (the  difference between the minimal luminal diameter immediately after the procedure  and the diameter at six months). Secondary end points included the percentage of  in-stent stenosis of the luminal diameter and the rate of restenosis (luminal  narrowing of 50 percent or more). We also analyzed a composite clinical end point  consisting of death, myocardial infarction, and percutaneous or surgical  revascularization at 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: At six months, the degree of  neointimal proliferation, manifested as the mean (+/-SD) late luminal loss, was  significantly lower in the sirolimus-stent group (-0.01+/-0.33 mm) than in the  standard-stent group (0.80+/-0.53 mm, P{$<$}0.001). None of the patients in the  sirolimus-stent group, as compared with 26.6 percent of those in the  standard-stent group, had restenosis of 50 percent or more of the luminal  diameter (P{$<$}0.001). There were no episodes of stent thrombosis. During a  follow-up period of up to one year, the overall rate of major cardiac events was  5.8 percent in the sirolimus-stent group and 28.8 percent in the standard-stent  group (P{$<$}0.001). The difference was due entirely to a higher rate of  revascularization of the target vessel in the standard-stent group. CONCLUSIONS:  As compared with a standard coronary stent, a sirolimus-eluting stent shows  considerable promise for the prevention of neointimal proliferation, restenosis,  and associated clinical events.},

However, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie these side effects, especially constipation induced by opioid receptor agonists; i.e., do they involve naloxonazine-sensitive versus -insensitive sites or central-versus-peripheral mu-opioid receptors? The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of mu-opioid receptor agonist-induced constipation (i.e., the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit and colonic expulsion) that are antagonized by the peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist naloxone methiodide and naloxonazine in mice. Naloxonazine attenuated the fentanyl-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal transit more potently than the inhibition induced by morphine or oxycodone. Naloxone methiodide suppressed the oxycodone-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal transit more potently than the inhibition induced by morphine, indicating that mu-opioid receptor agonists induce the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit through different mechanisms. Furthermore, we found that the route of administration (intracerebroventricular, intrathecally, and/or intraperitoneally) of naloxone methiodide differentially influenced the suppressive effect on the inhibition of colorectal transit induced by morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. These results suggest that morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl induce constipation through different mechanisms (naloxonazine-sensitive versus naloxonazine-insensitive sites and central versus peripheral opioid receptors), and these findings may help us to understand the characteristics of the constipation induced by each mu-opioid receptor agonist and improve the quality of life by reducing constipation in patients being treated for pain.},

Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries is a heterogeneous entity; a meta-analysis of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery studies demonstrated that all-cause mortality rate at 1 year is 4.7\%, and its prognosis is not so favourable.A 62-year-old man without remarkable medical history complained of acute chest pain at rest, which resolved at his arrival. Although echocardiography and electrocardiogram exhibited normal findings, the concentration of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T increased up to 0.384 from 0.04\>ng/mL. Coronary angiography was performed, and mild stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery was detected. He was discharged without catheter intervention and medications as he reported no symptoms. He returned 8 days later because of inferoposterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation. Emergent coronary angiography showed that the mild stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery had progressed to total occlusion. Optical coherence tomography after thrombectomy revealed rupture of the thin-cap fibroatheroma and protruding thrombus.Patients presenting with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries and plaque disruption and/or thrombus detected by optical coherence tomography do not show normal coronaries on coronary angiography. Aggressive investigation into plaque disruption using intracoronary imaging is recommended even if coronary angiography demonstrates mild stenosis to prevent a fatal attack for suspicious cases of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries.}

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90\% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the etiology of hypercalcemia, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis of rare causes of hypercalcemia, extending the observations of the original article. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive extensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology," as well as examining the references in the identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults vs pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definitive assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanism with discussion of likely etiology. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause of hypercalcemia is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology. CONCLUSIONS: The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.},

Currently, the DCB is only indicated for treatment of in-stent restenosis  or small vessel lesions ({$<$}\,3.0~mm), but potential expansion for larger vessels  ({$\geq$}\,3.0~mm) may hasten its use in a wider range of lesions or patients with  obstructive coronary artery disease.

  abstract = {First generation drug-eluting stents have considerably reduced in-stent restenosis and broadened the applications of percutaneous coronary interventions for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The polymer is an integral part of drug-eluting stents in that, it controls the release of an antiproliferative drug. The main safety concern of first generation drug-eluting stents with permanent polymers---stent thrombosis---has been caused by local hypersensitivity, delayed vessel healing, and endothelial dysfunction. This has prompted the development of newer generation drug-eluting stents with biodegradable polymers or even polymer-free drug-eluting stents. Recent clinical trials have shown the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stents with biodegradable polymer, with proven reductions in very late stent thrombosis as compared to first generation drug-eluting stents. However, the concept of using a permanent metallic prosthesis implies major drawbacks, such as the presence of a foreign material within the native coronary artery that causes vascular inflammation and neoatherosclerosis, and also impedes the restoration of the vasomotor function of the stented segment. Bioresorbable scaffolds have been introduced to overcome these limitations, since they provide temporary scaffolding and then disappear, liberating the treated vessel from its cage. This update article presents the current status of these new technologies and highlights their future perspectives in interventional cardiology.},

BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have  reported variations in late lumen loss between first-generation sirolimus-eluting  stents (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). Little is known, however, about  the vascular responses, time course of healing, and underlying mechanism(s) of  complications of LST between platforms in human coronary implants. METHODS: The  overall analysis included 174 cases (230 DES lesions) from the CVPath Institute's  stent registry. Histomorphometry was performed on coronary stents from 127  patients (171 lesions) who died {$\geq$} 30 days after receiving stent implants in which  fibrin deposition, endothelial strut coverage, inflammatory response, and  mechanism(s) of in-stent thrombosis were assessed. RESULTS: Both platforms  demonstrated increased neointimal thickness over time where values were greater  in PES (mean 0.13 mm; range 0.03 to 0.20 mm) than SES (mean 0.10 mm; range 0.04  to 0.15 mm; p = 0.04). The percentage of uncovered struts was similar between SES  and PES including stents with LST (SES = 21\% vs. PES = 27\%; p = 0.47). The  underlying mechanism(s) of LST, however, was strikingly different between  platforms; localized strut hypersensitivity was exclusive to SES, whereas  malapposition secondary to excessive fibrin deposition was the underlying cause  in PES. Moreover, although both PES and SES showed nearly complete strut coverage  after 12 months for on-label use, the majority of stents placed for off-label  indications remained unhealed after 12 months in both types of DES. CONCLUSIONS:  Differential mechanisms of LST involving either hypersensitivity or excessive  fibrin were identified between first-generation DES in which overall stent  healing was further delayed in DES placed for off-label indications.},

BACKGROUND: Neointimal atherosclerotic  change (neoatherosclerosis) after BMS implantation is rarely reported and usually  occurs beyond 5 years. The incidence of neoatherosclerosis after DES implantation  has not been reported. METHODS: All available cases from the CVPath stent  registry (n = 299 autopsies), which includes a total of 406 lesions-197 BMS, 209  DES (103 sirolimus-eluting stents [SES] and 106 paclitaxel-eluting stents  [PES])-with implant duration {$>$}30 days were examined. Neoatherosclerosis was  recognized as clusters of lipid-laden foamy macrophages within the neointima with  or without necrotic core formation. RESULTS: The incidence of neoatherosclerosis  was significantly greater in DES lesions (31\%) than BMS lesions (16\%; p {$<$} 0.001).  The median stent duration with neoatherosclerosis was shorter in DES than BMS  (DES, 420 days [interquartile range [IQR]: 361 to 683 days]; BMS, 2,160 days  [IQR: 1,800 to 2,880 days], p {$<$} 0.001). Unstable lesions characterized as  thin-cap fibroatheromas or plaque rupture were more frequent in BMS (n = 7, 4\%)  than in DES (n = 3, 1\%; p = 0.17), with relatively shorter implant durations for  DES (1.5 {\textpm} 0.4 years) compared to BMS (6.1 {\textpm} 1.5 years). Independent determinants  of neoatherosclerosis identified by multiple logistic regression included younger  age (p {$<$} 0.001), longer implant durations (p {$<$} 0.001), SES usage (p {$<$} 0.001), PES  usage (p = 0.001), and underlying unstable plaques (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS:  Neoatherosclerosis is a frequent finding in DES and occurs earlier than in BMS.  Unstable features of neoatherosclerosis are identified for both BMS and DES with  shorter implant durations for the latter. The development of neoatherosclerosis  may be yet another rare contributing factor to late thrombotic events.},

  abstract = {Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a serious complication of myocardial infarction (MI), with its global incidence significantly reduced in recent years due to advances in coronary reperfusion techniques. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an unexpected rise in the incidence of post-MI VSD, likely driven by delays in seeking treatment. This study retrospectively analyzed 10 cases of post-MI VSD treated at our hospitals from March 2018 to August 2023, comparing incidence rates across pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. The findings revealed a notable increase in VSD cases during the pandemic, with six cases occurring in two years, compared to only two cases in each of the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. Despite these fluctuations, surgical intervention remained a crucial and effective treatment, with 60\% of patients surviving the 30-day follow-up. The study underscores the impact of delayed treatment on VSD incidence during the pandemic and highlights the critical need for timely medical intervention to manage severe MI complications effectively.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bleeding rates on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) within 1 month after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain high in clinical practice, particularly in patients with acute coronary syndrome or high bleeding risk. Aspirin-free strategy might result in lower bleeding early after PCI without increasing cardiovascular events, but its efficacy and safety have not yet been proven in randomized trials. METHODS: We randomly assigned 6002 patients with acute coronary syndrome or high bleeding risk just before PCI either to prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) monotherapy or to DAPT with aspirin (81-100 mg/day) and prasugrel (3.75 mg/day) after loading of 20 mg of prasugrel in both groups. The coprimary end points were major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5) for superiority and cardiovascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis, or ischemic stroke) for noninferiority with a relative 50\% margin. RESULTS: The full analysis set population consisted of 5966 patients (no-aspirin group, 2984 patients; DAPT group, 2982 patients; age, 71.6{\textpm}11.7 years; men, 76.6\%; acute coronary syndrome, 75.0\%). Within 7 days before randomization, aspirin alone, aspirin with P2Y12 inhibitor, oral anticoagulants, and intravenous heparin infusion were given in 21.3\%, 6.4\%, 8.9\%, and 24.5\%, respectively. Adherence to the protocol-specified antiplatelet therapy was 88\% in both groups at 1 month. At 1 month, the no-aspirin group was not superior to the DAPT group for the coprimary bleeding end point (4.47\% and 4.71\%; hazard ratio, 0.95 [95\% CI, 0.75-1.20]; P(superiority)=0.66). The no-aspirin group was noninferior to the DAPT group for the coprimary cardiovascular end point (4.12\% and 3.69\%; hazard ratio, 1.12 [95\% CI, 0.87-1.45]; P(non)(inferiority)=0.01). There was no difference in net adverse clinical outcomes and each component of coprimary cardiovascular end point. There was an excess of any unplanned coronary revascularization (1.05\% and 0.57\%; hazard ratio, 1.83 [95\%CI, 1.01-3.30]) and subacute definite or probable stent thrombosis (0.58\% and 0.17\%; hazard ratio, 3.40 [95\% CI, 1.26-9.23]) in the no-aspirin group compared with the DAPT group. CONCLUSIONS: The aspirin-free strategy using low-dose prasugrel compared with the DAPT strategy failed to attest superiority for major bleeding within 1 month after PCI but was noninferior for cardiovascular events within 1 month after PCI. However, the aspirin-free strategy was associated with a signal suggesting an excess of coronary events. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04609111.},

The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether oral coadministration of an anti-opioid agent, naloxone, can be considered a successful approach to overcome 'the morphine effect'. METHODS: Consecutive unstable angina patients receiving ticagrelor and morphine with or without orally administered naloxone underwent assessment of platelet reactivity using Multiplate analyzer as well as evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of ticagrelor and its active metabolite, AR-C124910XX, at 9 pre-defined time points within the first 6 hours following oral intake of the ticagrelor loading dose. RESULTS: The trial shows no significant differences regarding the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor between both study arms throughout the study period. AR-C124910XX plasma concentration was significantly higher 120 min after the ticagrelor loading dose administration (p = 0.0417). However, the evaluation of pharmacodynamics did not show any statistically significant differences between the study arms. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, this trial shows that naloxone co-administration in ticagrelor-treated acute coronary syndrome patients on concomitant treatment with morphine shows no definite superiority in terms of ticagrelor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.},

BACKGROUND: The increased amount of administered contrast agents is a major concern when performing intracoronary OCT. METHODS: The present study is a single-center, prospective, observational study including 10 patients with stable coronary artery disease. A total of 28 individual coronary arteries were assessed by both fast-pullback HF-OCT and by conventional OCT. RESULTS: The contrast volume used in each OCT run for the HF-OCT system was significantly lower than for the conventional OCT system (5.0\,{\textpm}\,0.0\,mL vs. 7.8\,{\textpm}\,0.7\,mL, respectively, with a mean difference of -2.84 [95\% confidence interval [CI]: -3.10 to -2.58]).

Fast-pullback HF-OCT showed comparable measurements to conventional OCT, including minimum lumen area (3.27\,{\textpm}\,1.53\,mm(2) vs. 3.21\,{\textpm}\,1.53\,mm(2) , p\,=\,0.27), proximal reference area (7.03\,{\textpm}\,2.28\,mm(2) vs. 7.03\,{\textpm}\,2.34\,mm(2) , p\,=\,0.96), and distal reference area (5.93\,{\textpm}\,1.96\,mm(2) vs. 6.03\,{\textpm}\,2.02\,mm(2) , p\,=\,0.23). Qualitative OCT findings were comparable between the fast-pullback HF-OCT runs and conventional OCT with respect to identifying lipid-rich plaques, calcifications, layered plaques, macrophages, and cholesterol crystals. CONCLUSION: With the fast pullback function of a novel HF-OCT imaging system, we acquired OCT images using a significantly lower amount of contrast volume while retaining a comparable qualitative and quantitative lesion assessment to conventional OCT.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.},

Historically, agents have been temporizing, having no impact on patient morbidity nor survival. We suggest that cinacalcet can be an efficacious agent to be taken orally, reducing patients' time in the hospital/clinic settings. It is well-tolerated and maintains serum calcium levels in the normal range, while targeted cancer treatments can be employed. This has a direct, major impact on morbidity. Maintaining eucalcemia can increase quality of life, while allowing targeted therapies time to improve survival. Given that our case (and others) showed calcium reduction in MAH, there is promising evidence that cinacalcet can be more widely employed in this setting. Future consideration should be given to studies addressing the efficacy of cinacalcet in calcium normalization, improvement of quality of life, and impact on survival in patients with MAH. Though the exact mechanism of action for cinacalcet's reduction in calcium in this setting is not currently known, we can still afford patients the possible benefit from it.},

BACKGROUND: FFR is the reference standard for physiologic assessment of coronary stenosis and guidance of revascularization, especially in patients with MVD, yet it remains grossly underutilized. The non-wire based FFRangio performs well in non-MVD patients, but its accuracy in MVD is unknown. METHODS: A prospective clinical study was conducted at Gifu Heart Centre, Japan. Patients underwent physiologic assessment of all relevant coronary lesions using wire-based FFR (wbFFR) and FFRangio. Primary outcome was diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) for FFRangio with wbFFR as reference. Other outcomes were the correlation between wbFFR/FFRangio, time required for wbFFR/FFRangio measurements, and the effect of wbFFR/FFRangio on the reclassification of coronary disease severity. RESULTS: Fifty patients (118 lesions in total) were included. Mean age was 72\,{\textpm}\,9\,years, 72\% were male, 36\% had triple vessel disease and the average SYNTAX score was 13. The mean measurement of wbFFR and FFRangio were 0.83\,{\textpm}\,0.12 and 0.81\,{\textpm}\,0.11, respectively. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for FFRangio were 92.3\% (95\% CI 79.1-98.4\%), 92.4\% (95\% CI 84.3-97.2\%) and 92.4\% (95\% CI 87.4-97.3\%), respectively. Pearson's r between wbFFR and FFRangio was 0.83. FFRangio measurement was faster than wbFFR (9.6\,{\textpm}\,3.4 vs. 15.0\,{\textpm}\,8.9\,min, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MVD, FFRangio shows good correlation and excellent diagnostic performance compared to wbFFR, and measuring FFRangio is faster than wbFFR. These results highlight the potential clinical benefits of utilizing FFRangio among patients with MVD.},

BACKGROUND: Chest pain at rest is a frequent symptom in the emergency room. Acute coronary syndrome is suspected in patients with elevation of cardiac markers, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or simply typical clinical symptoms of unstable (usually resting) angina. However, of all patients with suspected ACS who undergo coronary angiography, up to 30\% have nonobstructed coronary arteries. We sought to clarify how many of these patients suffer from coronary spasm as a possible cause of their chest pain. METHODS: In a prospective study from June to December 2006, all patients with suspected ACS who underwent coronary angiography and had no culprit lesion underwent intracoronary provocation with acetylcholine. The ACH testing was considered positive at a vasoconstriction of {$>$}/=75\% relative to the diameter after intracoronary nitroglycerine when the initially reported symptoms could be reproduced. RESULTS: Of 488 consecutive patients, 138 had no culprit lesion (28\%). Twenty-two were found to have another diagnosis. The ACH testing was performed in 86 of the remaining 116 patients. In 42 patients, coronary spasm was verified (49\%). CONCLUSIONS: Every fourth patient with ACS had no culprit lesion. Coronary spasm could be documented in nearly 50\% of the patients tested by ACH. Coronary spasm is a frequent cause of ACS and should regularly be considered as a differential diagnosis.},

Asian patients have different patterns of thrombotic and bleeding risk from other populations which may be particularly relevant in the setting of PPCI for STEMI. OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of the polymer free biolimus coated coronary stent (PF-BCS, BioFreedom(TM), Biosensors International) in Asian STEMI patients. METHODS: Patients with acute STEMI who received at least one PF-BCS were invited to participate after their index procedure. Follow-up was performed at 1, 4, and 12 months. The primary endpoint was the rate of target lesion failure (TLF) at 1 year. A performance goal was derived from the biolimus eluting stent arm of the COMFORTABLE AMI study which was the only prior dedicated study of biolimus eluting stents in patients with STEMI. RESULTS: A total of 914 patients with STEMI were enrolled. Mean patient age was 60\,{\textpm}\,13\,years, diabetes was present in 23.2\% and 43\% were active smokers. According to the ARC definition, 12.4\% of the patients were HBR. TLF rate was 2.54\% [95\% CI: 1.52-3.56], p-value for non-inferiority {$<$}0.0001, p-value for superiority\,=\,0.0004). The rate of definite/probable stent thrombosis was 0.44\% [95\% CI: 0.16-1.16]. There was a trend toward more BARC 3 to 5 bleeding in ARC-HBR patients (3.69\% vs 1.46\%, HR\,=\,2.74, [95\% CI: 0.87-8.62], p\,=\,0.07).

We describe the in-hospital and 3-month outcomes of patients who have had this procedure. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was performed of all patients admitted to a tertiary care center over a 10-year period with a chest tube placed for hepatic hydrothorax. Demographic data and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified; 12 were taking diuretics and 8 were taking multiple diuretics at the time of admission. MELD score was 14 (range = 7-34). During hospitalization, 16 had at least 1 and 12 had more than 1 complications. The most common complications were acute kidney injury (n = 11), pneumothorax (n = 7), and empyema (n = 5). Two patients died during the index admission and four others within 3 months of that admission. Six of seven patients who received TIPS survived. CONCLUSIONS: Chest tube insertion for hepatic hydrothorax carries significant morbidity and mortality, with questionable benefit.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatic hydrothorax (HHT) is an uncommon but significant complication of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, associated with a worse prognosis and mortality. Nearly 25\% of patients with HHT will have refractory pleural effusion. It is unclear if refractory HHT has a different prognosis compared to refractory ascites. AIMS: We aim to evaluate the prognostic significance of refractory HHT when compared to refractory ascites. METHODS: Forty-seven patients who had refractory HHT in a tertiary care center were identified, and matched, retrospectively, one-to-one by age, gender and MELD-Na with 47 patients with refractory ascites. One-year mortality rate was compared between both groups. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify the association between different covariates and primary endpoint. RESULTS: The 1-year mortality was 51.06\% in the HHT group compared to 19.15\% in the refractory ascites group. The median survival for patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax was 4.87~months while the median survival for patients with refractory ascites exceeded 1~year. The presence of HHT was statistically significant in predicting the development of 1-year mortality [Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.45, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.25-8.82; P value\,{$<$}\,0.001]. Furthermore, refractory HHT remained associated with one-year mortality after adjusting for all other covariates. In a subgroup of patients with MELD-Na\,{$\leq$}\,20, HHT continued to be a significant predictor of one-year mortality (HR 3.30, 95\% CI 1.47-7.40; P value 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Refractory HHT is a significant independent predictor of mortality and offers additional prognostic value.},

It remains  unclear whether vascular responses to CoCr-EES are different from those to SES  and PES because the pathology of CoCr-EES has not been described in humans.  METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 204 lesions (SES=73; PES=85; CoCr-EES=46) from  149 autopsy cases with duration of implantation {$>$}30 days and {$\leq$}3 years were  pathologically analyzed, and comparison of vascular responses was corrected for  duration of implantation. The observed frequency of late and very late stent  thrombosis was less in CoCr-EES (4\%) versus SES (21\%; P=0.029) and PES (26\%;  P=0.008). Neointimal thickness was comparable among the groups, whereas the  percentage of uncovered struts was strikingly lower in CoCr-EES (median=2.6\%)  versus SES (18.0\%; P{$<$}0.0005) and PES (18.7\%; P{$<$}0.0005). CoCr-EES showed a lower  inflammation score (with no hypersensitivity) and less fibrin deposition versus  SES and PES. The observed frequency of neoatherosclerosis, however, did not  differ significantly among the groups (CoCr-EES=29\%; SES=35\%; PES=19\%). CoCr-EES  had the least frequency of stent fracture (CoCr-EES=13\%; SES=40\%; PES=19\%;  P=0.007 for CoCr-EES versus SES), whereas fracture-related restenosis or  thrombosis was comparable among the groups (CoCr-EES=6.5\%; SES=5.5\%; PES=1.2\%).  CONCLUSIONS: CoCr-EES demonstrated greater strut coverage with less inflammation,  less fibrin deposition, and less late and very late stent thrombosis compared  with SES and PES in human autopsy analysis. Nevertheless, the observed  frequencies of neoatherosclerosis and fracture-related adverse pathological  events were comparable in these devices, indicating that careful long-term  follow-up remains important even after CoCr-EES placement.},

BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that BP-BES  might reduce the risk of stent thrombosis (ST) and late adverse outcomes compared  with first-generation DES. However, the relative safety and efficacy of BP-BES  versus newer-generation DES coated with more biocompatible DP have not been  investigated in depth. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials comparing BP-BES  versus currently U.S.-approved DES or BMS were searched through MEDLINE, EMBASE,  and Cochrane databases. Information on study design, inclusion and exclusion  criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted. RESULTS:  Data from 89 trials including 85,490 patients were analyzed. At 1-year follow-up,  BP-BES were associated with lower rates of cardiac death/myocardial infarction  (MI), MI, and target vessel revascularization (TVR) than BMS and lower rates of  TVR than fast-release zotarolimus-eluting stents. The BP-BES had similar rates of  cardiac death/MI, MI, and TVR compared with other second-generation DP-DES but  higher rates of 1-year ST than cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents  (CoCr-EES). The BP-BES were associated with improved late outcomes compared with  BMS and paclitaxel-eluting stents, considering the latest follow-up data  available, with nonsignificantly different outcomes compared with other DP-DES  although higher rates of definite ST compared with CoCr-EES. CONCLUSIONS: In this  large-scale network meta-analysis, BP-BES were associated with superior clinical  outcomes compared with BMS and first-generation DES and similar rates of cardiac  death/MI, MI, and TVR compared with second-generation DP-DES but higher rates of  definite ST than CoCr-EES.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the action of prasugrel and ticagrelor in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). BACKGROUND: It has been documented that prasugrel and ticagrelor are able to provide effective platelet inhibition 2 h after a loading dose (LD). However, the pharmacodynamic measurements after prasugrel and ticagrelor LD have been provided by assessing only healthy volunteers or subjects with stable coronary artery disease. METHODS: Fifty patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI with bivalirudin monotherapy were randomized to receive 60 mg prasugrel LD (n = 25) or 180 mg ticagrelor LD (n = 25). Residual platelet reactivity was assessed by VerifyNow at baseline and 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after LD. RESULTS: Platelet reactivity units (PRU) 2 h after the LD (study primary endpoint) were 217 (12 to 279) and 275 (88 to 305) in the prasugrel and ticagrelor groups, respectively (p = NS), satisfying pre-specified noninferiority criteria. High residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) (PRU {$\geq$}240) was found in 44\% and 60\% of patients (p = 0.258) at 2 h. The mean time to achieve a PRU {$<$}240 was 3 {\textpm} 2 h and 5 {\textpm} 4 h in the prasugrel and ticagrelor groups, respectively. The independent predictors of HRPR at 2 h were morphine use (odds ratio: 5.29; 95\% confidence interval: 1.44 to 19.49; p = 0.012) and baseline PRU value (odds ratio: 1.014; 95\% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.03; p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with STEMI, prasugrel showed to be noninferior as compared with ticagrelor in terms of residual platelet reactivity 2 h after the LD. The 2 drugs provide an effective platelet inhibition 2 h after the LD in only a half of patients, and at least 4 h are required to achieve an effective platelet inhibition in the majority of patients. Morphine use is associated with a delayed activity of these agents. (Rapid Activity of Platelet Inhibitor Drugs Study, NCT01510171).},

Suboptimal antiplatelet effect during and after primary percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with increased thrombotic complications. It was hypothesized a potential drug-drug interaction between morphine and antiplatelet agents. We sought to assess platelet inhibition after a loading dose of the currently recommended antiplatelet agents in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients according to morphine use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three hundred patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention receiving either prasugrel (n = 95) or ticagrelor (n = 205) loading dose had platelet reactivity assessed by VerifyNow 1, 2, and 4 hours after loading dose. Patients treated with morphine (n = 95; 32\%) had a higher incidence of vomit (15\% versus 2\%; P = 0.001). P2Y12 reactivity units 2 hours after the loading dose was 187 (153-221) and 133 (102-165) in patient with and without morphine (P {$<$} 0.001); the difference persisted after excluding patients with vomit (P {$<$} 0.0001). High residual platelet reactivity (P2Y12 reactivity units {$>$}/= 208) at 2 hours was found in 53\% and 29\% patients with and without morphine (P {$<$} 0.001) and without difference between prasugrel and ticagrelor patients. The independent predictors of high residual platelet reactivity at 2 hours were morphine use (odds ratio, 2.91 [1.71-4.97]; P {$<$} 0.0001) and age (odds ratio, 1.03 [1.01-1.05]; P = 0.010). Morphine remained associated with high residual platelet reactivity after propensity score adjustment (c-statistic, 0.68; 95\% confidence interval, 0.66-0.70; P = 0.879 for Hosmer-Lemeshow test). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, morphine use is associated with a delayed onset of action of the oral antiplatelet agents. This association persisted after adjusting for the propensity to receive morphine and after excluding patients with vomit.},

Aim of the present study was to evaluate platelet inhibition with 180~mg ticagrelor loading dose (LD) administered as ODT compared with standard coated tablet ticagrelor formulation in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) according to morphine use. METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred and 30 patients presenting with STEMI or very high-risk NSTE-ACS were randomly assigned to receive ODT or standard ticagrelor LD. Potential morphine-ticagrelor interaction was assessed by stratified randomization according to morphine use. Platelet reactivity was evaluated by Platelet Reactivity Units (PRU) VerifyNow™ 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after ticagrelor LD. The primary endpoint was residual platelet reactivity 1 h after LD across the two ticagrelor formulation and according to morphine use. Safety endpoints were major bleedings and other in-hospital ticagrelor administration-related adverse events. One hour after LD, PRU median value was higher in morphine-treated patients (N~=~32) as compared with patients not receiving morphine (N~=~98; PRU~=~187 [70-217]) vs. 73 [7-187]; P~=~0.012). In patients with morphine, 1-h PRU values were similar between study groups (192 [114-236] vs. 173 [16-215] in ODT and standard tablet ticagrelor, respectively). Similarly, in patients without morphine, 1-h PRU values were not significantly different between study groups (69 [8-152] vs. 110 [6-193] in ODT and standard tablet ticagrelor, respectively). Platelet reactivity appeared similar in the 2 study arms at 2, 4, and 6 h after LD. No significant difference was observed among patients with or without morphine regarding in-hospital adverse events or drug side-effects, even if a reinfarction due to acute stent thrombosis was observed in a patient treated with morphine. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between ODT and standard ticagrelor tablets in terms of post-LD residual platelet reactivity, percentage of platelet inhibition or safety regardless to morphine use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after acute myocardial infarction has been proven to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality.  Historically, participation rates have been low, and although recent efforts have  increased referral rates, current data on CR participation are limited. METHODS  AND RESULTS: Utilizing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we performed a  population-based, cross-sectional analysis of CR post-acute myocardial  infarction. Unadjusted participation from 2005 to 2015 was evaluated by  univariable logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression was performed  with patient characteristic variables to determine adjusted trends and  associations with participation in CR in more recent years from 2011 to 2015.  Among the 32~792 survey respondents between 2005 and 2015, participation ranged  from 35\% in 2005 to 39\% in 2009 (P=0.005) and from 38\% in 2011 to 32\% in 2015  (P=0.066). Between 2011 and 2015, participants were less likely to be female  (odds ratio [OR] 0.763, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.646-0.903), black (OR  0.700, 95\% CI 0.526-0.931), uninsured (OR 0.528, 95\% CI 0.372-0.751), less  educated (OR 0.471, 95\% CI 0.367-0.605), current smokers (OR 0.758, 95\% CI  0.576-0.999), and were more likely to be retired or self-employed (OR 1.393, 95\%  CI 1.124-1.726). CONCLUSIONS: Only one third of patients participate in CR  following acute myocardial infarction despite the known health benefits.  Participants are less likely to be female, black, and uneducated. Future studies  should focus on methods to maximize the proportion of CR referrals converted into  CR participation.},

This study reports the  angiographic appearance of the infarct-related artery (IRA) in 130 patients with  a history of MI, who underwent cardiac catheterization 2 weeks to more than 12  months afterwards. The IRA was the left anterior descending in 47\%, the right  coronary artery in 50\%, and the circumflex in 3\% of cases. Total coronary  occlusion was found in 80\% of patients studied 2 to 4 weeks after MI, and  decreased gradually reaching 40\% of those studied after 12 months of MI. In those  patients with a patent IRA, severe stenosis remained: 99\% obstruction at 2 to 4  weeks, decreasing to 85.9\% obstruction after 12 months (p less than 0.005). The  prevalence of total coronary occlusion (TCO) and the severity of stenosis in  those without TCO was similar in those with transmural or nontransmural MI and in  those with one-, two- or three-vessel disease. This study suggests that  endogenous lysis is probably a slow process, and that severe coronary narrowing  persists in those with recanalization.},

The median survival of patients with cirrhosis who develop HH is 8-12~months. The diagnosis is typically made in the context of advanced liver disease and ascites, in the absence of underlying cardio-pulmonary pathology. A multi-disciplinary approach to management, involving respiratory physicians, hepatologists, and palliative care specialists is crucial to ensuring optimal patient-centered care. However, the majority of accepted therapeutic options are based on expert opinion rather than large, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and management of HH, highlighting the use of salt restriction and diuretic therapy, porto-systemic shunts, and liver transplantation. We include specific sections focusing on the role of pleural interventions and palliative care, respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Troponin elevation is a risk factor for mortality in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes. However, the prognosis of patients with troponin elevation and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the impact of nonobstructive CAD in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes and troponin elevation enrolled in the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the ACUITY trial, 3-vessel quantitative coronary angiography was performed in a formal substudy of 6921 patients presenting with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes. Patients with elevated admission troponin levels were stratified by the presence or absence of obstructive CAD (any lesion with quantitative diameter stenosis {$>$}50\%). Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for baseline characteristics. Of 2442 patients with elevated troponin, 197 (8.8\%) had nonobstructive CAD. Maximum diameter stenosis was 87.4 (73.2, 100.0) versus 22.6 (19.2, 25.7; P{$<$}0.0001) in patients with versus without obstructive CAD, respectively. Propensity matching yielded 117 patients with nonobstructive CAD and 331 patients with obstructive CAD, with no significant baseline differences between groups. In the matched cohort, overall 1-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with nonobstructive CAD (5.2\% versus 1.6\%; hazard ratio [95\% confidence interval]=3.44 [1.05, 11.28]; P=0.04), driven by greater noncardiac mortality. Conversely, recurrent myocardial infarction and unplanned revascularization rates were significantly higher in patients with obstructive CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes and elevated troponin levels but without obstructive CAD, while having low rates of subsequent myocardial infarction and unplanned revascularization, are still at considerable risk for 1-year mortality from noncardiac causes.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with drug-coated balloons (DCB) might be a promising trade-off between balloon angioplasty and drug-eluting  stents, since DCB inhibit neointimal proliferation and limit duration of dual  antiplatelet therapy. We investigated the safety, feasibility, and 6-month  results of fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided use of the paclitaxel-coated  SeQuent Please({\textregistered}) balloon without stenting for elective PCI of de novo lesions.  METHODS AND RESULTS: In 46 patients (54 lesions) with stable symptomatic coronary  artery disease (CAD), a FFR-guided POBA (plain old balloon angioplasty) was  performed. In case of a sufficient POBA result with residual stenosis~{$<~$}40~\%,  FFR~{$>~$}0.8 and no severe dissection, the target lesion was finally dilated using  the DCB. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was performed before and after  the index procedure and at 6-month follow-up (f/u) to calculate late lumen loss  (LLL) and net luminal gain (NLG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was  performed at f/u to assess vascular remodeling. DCB-only treatment was applied to  43 patients (51 lesions), while 3 patients (3 lesions) needed provisional  stenting. Invasive f/u was completed in 39 patients (47 lesions). At the stenotic  site, the lumen diameter showed a trend toward progressive increase at f/u (LLL:  -0.13~{\textpm}~0.44~mm, n.s.; NLG: 1.10~{\textpm}~0.53~mm, p~{$<~$}0.001) without aneurysm formation  or restenosis after DCB-only treatment. CONCLUSIONS: FFR-guided DCB-only PCI of  de novo lesions appeared feasible and safe in stable CAD with clopidogrel  discontinuation after 4~weeks, showing a trend toward positive vessel remodeling  without lumen loss at 6~months.

BACKGROUND: OCT provides unprecedented high-definition visualization of plaque/stent structures during PCI; however, the impact of OCT findings on outcome remains undefined. METHODS: In the context of the multicenter CLI-OPCI (Centro per la Lotta contro l'Infarto-Optimisation of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) registry, we retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing end-procedural OCT assessment and compared the findings with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1,002 lesions (832 patients) were assessed. Appropriate OCT assessment was obtained in 98.2\% of cases and revealed suboptimal stent implantation in 31.0\% of lesions, with increased incidence in patients experiencing major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up (59.2\% vs. 26.9\%; p {$<$} 0.001). In particular, in-stent minimum lumen area {$<$}4.5 mm(2) (hazards ratio [HR]: 1.64; p = 0.040), dissection {$>$}200 {$\mu$}m at the distal stent edge (HR: 2.54; p = 0.004), and reference lumen area {$<$}4.5 mm(2) at either distal (HR: 4.65; p {$<$} 0.001) or proximal (HR: 5.73; p {$<$} 0.001) stent edges were independent predictors of MACE. Conversely, in-stent minimum lumen area/mean reference lumen area {$<$}70\% (HR: 1.21; p = 0.45), stent malapposition {$>$}200 {$\mu$}m (HR: 1.15; p = 0.52), intrastent plaque/thrombus protrusion {$>$}500 {$\mu$}m (HR: 1.00; p = 0.99), and dissection {$>$}200 {$\mu$}m at the proximal stent edge (HR: 0.83; p = 0.65) were not associated with worse outcomes. Using multivariable Cox hazard analysis, the presence of at least 1 significant criterion for suboptimal OCT stent deployment was confirmed as an independent predictor of MACE (HR: 3.53; 95\% confidence interval: 2.2 to 5.8; p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal stent deployment defined according to specific quantitative OCT criteria was associated with an increased risk of MACE during follow-up.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of high-dose compared with standard-dose clopidogrel in patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity after PCI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, double-blind, active-control trial (Gauging Responsiveness with A VerifyNow assay-Impact on Thrombosis And Safety [GRAVITAS]) of 2214 patients with high on-treatment reactivity 12 to 24 hours after PCI with drug-eluting stents at 83 centers in North America between July 2008 and April 2010. INTERVENTIONS: High-dose clopidogrel (600-mg initial dose, 150 mg daily thereafter) or standard-dose clopidogrel (no additional loading dose, 75 mg daily) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was the 6-month incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. The key safety end point was severe or moderate bleeding according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) definition. A key pharmacodynamic end point was the rate of persistently high on-treatment reactivity at 30 days. RESULTS: At 6 months, the primary end point had occurred in 25 of 1109 patients (2.3\%) receiving high-dose clopidogrel compared with 25 of 1105 patients (2.3\%) receiving standard-dose clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.76; P = .97). Severe or moderate bleeding was not increased with the high-dose regimen (15 [1.4\%] vs 25 [2.3\%], HR, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.31-1.11; P = .10). Compared with standard-dose clopidogrel, high-dose clopidogrel provided a 22\% (95\% CI, 18\%-26\%) absolute reduction in the rate of high on-treatment reactivity at 30 days (62\%; 95\% CI, 59\%-65\% vs 40\%; 95\% CI, 37\%-43\%; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with high on-treatment reactivity after PCI with drug-eluting stents, the use of high-dose clopidogrel compared with standard-dose clopidogrel did not reduce the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circumflex (CX) artery-related myocardial infarction (MI) is less well represented in trials on ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI),  most often due to the absence of significant ST-segment elevation, and therefore  the outcome of these patients is less well known. We aimed to compare the outcome  of patients with CX versus right coronary artery (RCA) related STEMI in a large  cohort of patients treated with primary angioplasty. METHODS: A total of 1683  consecutive patients with STEMI were studied. Patients who lacked STsegment  elevation were also included if they had persistent chest pain with signs of  ischaemia or regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Coronary  angioplasty was performed according to standard procedures. After the  intervention, all patients received aspirin and clopidogrel or ticlopidine.  RESULTS: The infarct-related vessel was the CX in 229 patients (14\%) and the RCA  in 600 patients (36\%). No differences in baseline characteristics were present.  Mean extent of ST-segment elevation or deviation was significantly higher in  patients with the RCA as infarct-related vessel. Enzymatic infarct size was  significantly higher in the CXrelated MI (1338+/-1117 IU/l vs. 1806+/-1498 IU/l,  p{$<$}0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction {$<$}45\% was more often present in  patients with CXrelated MI (37 vs. 26\%, p{$<$}0.01). Both short- and long-term  mortality were significantly higher in the CX-related MI. CONCLUSION: This study  emphasises the fact that CX-related infarction has a worse prognosis compared  with RCA-related infarction. (Neth Heart J 2007;15:286-90.).},

  abstract = {The traditional management of acute coronary syndrome has relied on the identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as a proxy  of acute coronary occlusion. This conflation of STEMI with acute coronary  occlusion has historically overshadowed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial  infarction (NSTEMI), despite evidence suggesting 25\% to 34\% of NSTEMI cases may  also include acute coronary occlusion. Current limitations in the STEMI/NSTEMI  binary framework underscore the need for a revised approach to chest pain and  acute coronary syndrome management. The emerging paradigm distinguishing  occlusion myocardial infarction from nonocclusion myocardial infarction (NOMI)  seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic effect in acute coronary  syndrome care. This approach not only emphasizes the urgency of reperfusion  therapy for high-risk ECG patterns not covered by current STEMI criteria, but  also emphasizes the broader transition from viewing acute coronary syndrome as a  disease defined by the ECG to a disease defined by its underlying pathology, for  which the ECG is an important but insufficient surrogate test. This report  outlines the emerging occlusion myocardial infarction paradigm, detailing  specific ECG patterns linked to acute coronary occlusion, and proposes a new  framework that could enhance triage accuracy and treatment strategies for acute  coronary syndrome. Although further validation is required, the occlusion  myocardial infarction pathway holds promise for earlier acute coronary occlusion  detection, timely cath lab activation, and improved myocardial salvage-offering  potentially significant implications for both clinical practice and future  research in acute coronary syndrome management.},

A total of 140,573 patients with liver cirrhosis were identified. Of this, 1981 patients had a hepatic hydrothorax and ended up with either thoracentesis (1776) or chest tube (205). The mortality in those who received a chest tube was two times higher than that in thoracentesis group with a P value of {$\leq$}0.001 (CI 1.43-312). In addition, the length of hospital stay of the chest tube group was longer than that of the thoracentesis subset (7.2 days versus 3.8 days, resp.).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal technique of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients at high bleeding risk is not known. The hypothesis of the DEBUT trial  was that percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-coated balloons is  non-inferior to percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stents for  this population. METHODS: The DEBUT trial is a randomised, single-blind  non-inferiority trial done at five sites in Finland. Patients were eligible if  they had an ischaemic de-novo lesion in a coronary artery or bypass graft that  could be treated with drug-coated balloons, at least one risk factor for  bleeding, and a reference vessel diameter of 2{$\cdot$}5-4{$\cdot$}0 mm. Those with myocardial  infarction with ST-elevation, bifurcation lesions needing a two-stent technique,  in-stent restenosis, and flow-limiting dissection or substantial recoil ({$>$}30\%) of  the target lesion after predilation were excluded. After successful predilation  of the target lesion, patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of a  computer-generated random sequence, to percutaneous coronary intervention with a  balloon coated with paclitaxel and iopromide or a bare-metal stent. The primary  outcome was major adverse cardiac events at 9 months. Non-inferiority was shown  if the absolute risk difference was no more than 3\%. All prespecified analyses  were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01781546. FINDINGS: Between May 22, 2013, and Jan  16, 2017, 220 patients were recruited for the study and 208 patients were  assigned to percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-coated balloon (n=102)  or bare metal stent (n=106). At 9 months, major adverse cardiac events had  occurred in one patient (1\%) in the drug-coated balloon group and in 15 patients  (14\%) in the bare-metal stent group (absolute risk difference -13{$\cdot$}2 percentage  points [95\% CI -6{$\cdot$}2 to -21{$\cdot$}1], risk ratio 0{$\cdot$}07 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}01 to 0{$\cdot$}52]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}00001  for non-inferiority and p=0{$\cdot$}00034 for superiority). Two definitive stent  thrombosis events occurred in the bare metal stent group but no acute vessel  closures in the drug-coated balloon group. INTERPRETATIONS: Percutaneous coronary  intervention with drug-coated balloon was superior to bare-metal stents in  patients at bleeding risk. The drug-coated balloon-only coronary intervention is  a novel strategy to treat this difficult patient population. Comparison of this  approach to the new generation drug-eluting stents is warranted in the future.

In  response, the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative developed a  road map to improve CR use, including increasing participation rates to {$\geq$}70\% by  2022. This observational study provides current estimates to measure progress and  identifies the populations and regions most at risk for CR service  underutilization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified Medicare fee-for-service  beneficiaries who were CR eligible in 2016, and assessed CR participation ({$\geq$}1 CR  session attended), timely initiation (participation within 21 days of event), and  completion ({$\geq$}36 sessions attended) through 2017. Measures were assessed overall,  by beneficiary characteristics and geography, and by primary CR-qualifying event  type (acute myocardial infarction hospitalization; coronary artery bypass  surgery; heart valve repair/replacement; percutaneous coronary intervention; or  heart/heart-lung transplant). Among 366 103 CR-eligible beneficiaries, 89 327  (24.4\%) participated in CR, of whom 24.3\% initiated within 21 days and 26.9\%  completed CR. Eligibility was highest in the East South Central Census Division  (14.8 per 1000). Participation decreased with increasing age, was lower among  women (18.9\%) compared with men (28.6\%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.91 [95\% CI,  0.90-0.93]) was lower among Hispanics (13.2\%) and non-Hispanic blacks (13.6\%)  compared with non-Hispanic whites (25.8\%; adjusted prevalence ratio: 0.63  [0.61-0.66] and 0.70 [0.67-0.72], respectively), and varied by hospital referral  region and Census Division (range: 18.6\% [East South Central] to 39.1\% [West  North Central]) and by qualifying event type (range: 7.1\% [acute myocardial  infarction without procedure] to 55.3\% [coronary artery bypass surgery only]).  Timely initiation varied by geography and qualifying event type; completion  varied by geography. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 4 CR-eligible Medicare beneficiaries  participated in CR and marked disparities were observed. Reinforcement of current  effective strategies and development of new strategies will be critical to  address the noted disparities and achieve the 70\% participation goal.},

The Opiates produce analgesia and other adverse effects through activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) encoded by the Oprm1 gene. However, MOR and morphine metabolism involvement in OIH have been little explored. Hence, we examined MOR contribution to OIH by comparing morphine-induced hyperalgesia in wild type (WT) and MOR knockout (KO) mice. We found that repeated morphine administration led to analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in WT mice but not in MOR KO mice. The absence of OIH in MOR KO mice was found in both sexes, in two KO global mutant lines, and for mechanical, heat and cold pain modalities. In addition, the morphine metabolite morphine-3beta-D-glucuronide (M3G) elicited hyperalgesia in WT but not in MOR KO animals, as well as in both MOR flox and MOR-Nav1.8 sensory neuron conditional KO mice. M3G displayed significant binding to MOR and G-protein activation when using membranes from MOR-transfected cells or WT mice but not from MOR KO mice. Collectively our results show that MOR is involved in hyperalgesia induced by chronic morphine and its metabolite M3G.},

METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized trial, in a primary analysis involving 7243 patients under the age of 75 years receiving aspirin, we evaluated up to 30 months of treatment with prasugrel (10 mg daily) versus clopidogrel (75 mg daily). In a secondary analysis involving 2083 patients 75 years of age or older, we evaluated 5 mg of prasugrel versus 75 mg of clopidogrel. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 17 months, the primary end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke among patients under the age of 75 years occurred in 13.9\% of the prasugrel group and 16.0\% of the clopidogrel group (hazard ratio in the prasugrel group, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.05; P=0.21). Similar results were observed in the overall population. The prespecified analysis of multiple recurrent ischemic events (all components of the primary end point) suggested a lower risk for prasugrel among patients under the age of 75 years (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 1.00; P=0.04). Rates of severe and intracranial bleeding were similar in the two groups in all age groups. There was no significant between-group difference in the frequency of nonhemorrhagic serious adverse events, except for a higher frequency of heart failure in the clopidogrel group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation, prasugrel did not significantly reduce the frequency of the primary end point, as compared with clopidogrel, and similar risks of bleeding were observed.

Crushing tablets has been suggested to lead to more favorable PK/PD profiles. To date, no studies have investigated the PK/PD effects of crushing prasugrel. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether crushing prasugrel is associated with more favorable drug bioavailability and platelet inhibitory effects compared with whole tablets in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI. METHODS: Our prospective, randomized, open-label study assessed STEMI patients undergoing PPCI (n~= 52) who were treated with a prasugrel 60-mg loading dose (LD) either as whole or crushed tablets. PK/PD analyses were performed at 7 time points. PD effects were measured as P2Y12 reaction units and platelet reactivity index, and PK by plasma levels of prasugrel's active metabolite. RESULTS: Compared with whole tablets, crushed prasugrel led to reduced P2Y12 reaction units by 30 min post-LD, which persisted at 1, 2 (164 vs. 95; least square mean difference~= 68; 95\% confidence interval: 10 to 126; primary endpoint), and 4 h post-LD. Significant differences were no longer present at 6 h post-LD. Parallel findings were shown with platelet reactivity index. Accordingly, high on-treatment platelet reactivity rates were reduced with crushed prasugrel. PK analyses showed a {$>$}3-fold faster absorption with crushed compared with whole prasugrel. CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients undergoing PPCI, crushed prasugrel leads to faster drug absorption, and consequently, more prompt and potent antiplatelet effects compared with whole tablet ingestion.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)  feature-tracking in a large multicenter population of patients with preserved  ejection fraction. BACKGROUND: Ejection fraction is the principal parameter used  clinically to assess cardiac mechanics and provides prognostic information.  However, significant abnormalities of myocardial deformation can be present  despite preserved ejection fraction. CMR feature-tracking techniques now allow  assessment of strain from routine cine images, without specialized pulse  sequences. Whether abnormalities of strain measured by using CMR feature-tracking  have prognostic value in patients with preserved ejection fraction is unknown.  METHODS: Consecutive patients with preserved ejection fraction ({$\geq$}50\%) and a  clinical indication for CMR at 4 U.S. medical centers were included in this  retrospective study. Feature-tracking GLS was calculated from 3 long-axis cine  views. The primary endpoint was all-cause death. Cox proportional hazards  regression modeling was used to examine the independent association between GLS  and death. The incremental prognostic value of GLS was assessed in nested models.  RESULTS: Of the 1,274 patients in this study, 115 died during a median follow-up  of 6.2 years. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with GLS {$\geq$} median (-20\%) had  significantly reduced event-free survival compared with those with GLS~{$<~$}median  (log-rank test, p~{$<~$}0.001). By Cox multivariable regression modeling, each 1\%  worsening in GLS was associated with a 22.8\% increased risk of death after  adjustment for clinical and imaging risk factors (hazard ratio: 1.228 per  percent; p~{$<~$}0.001). Addition of GLS in this model resulted in significant  improvement in the global chi-square test (94 to 183; p~{$<~$}0.001) and Harrell's  C-statistic (0.75 to 0.83; p~{$<~$}0.001).

  abstract = {{$<$}abstract{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Since the introduction of the first pharmacological therapy for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the early 20th century, treatment of myocardial infarction has evolved extensively throughout the years. Mechanical revascularization therapies such as the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, combined with the ongoing development of pharmacological therapies have successfully improved the survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction. To date, antiplatelet therapy (consisting of aspirin and an oral P2Y{$<$}inline-formula id="m1"{$><$}math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="w1" alttext="\{\}\_\{12\}" display="inline"{$><$}mml:msub{$><$}mml:mi/{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}12{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:msub{$><$}/math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$} inhibitor) and anticoagulation therapy represent the main stay of pharmacological treatment in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Unfractionated heparin remains the preferred anticoagulant therapy, despite the development of other anticoagulants, including enoxaparin and bivalirudin.

The use of potent intravenous antiplatelet agents, including the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and the intravenous P2Y{$<$}inline-formula id="m3"{$><$}math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="w3" alttext="\{\}\_\{12\}" display="inline"{$><$}mml:msub{$><$}mml:mi/{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}12{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:msub{$><$}/math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$} inhibitor cangrelor, is currently restricted to specific clinical settings. While several potent antithrombotic agents already exist, the search for novel potent antithrombotic agents continues, with a focus on balancing antithrombotic properties with an improved safety profile to reduce excess bleeding.

  abstract = {Objective: To measure the impact of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool on total modifiable cardiovascular risk at 12 months separately for outpatients with  3 subtypes of serious mental illness (SMI) identified via ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes:  bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: This  cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial was active from March 2016 to  September 2018; data were analyzed from April 2021 to September 2022. Clinicians  and patients from 78 primary care clinics participated. All 8,922 adult patients  aged 18-75 years with diagnosed SMI, at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor not at  goal, and an index and follow-up visit during the study period were included. The  CDS tool provided a summary of modifiable cardiovascular risk and personalized  treatment recommendations. Results: Intervention patients had 4\% relative  reduction in total modifiable cardiovascular risk at 12 months compared to  controls (relative risk ratio\,=\,0.96; 95\% CI, 0.94 to 0.98), with similar  intervention benefits for all 3 SMI subtypes. At index, 10-year cardiovascular  risk was higher for patients with schizophrenia (mean [SD] \,=\,11.3\% [9.2\%]) than  for patients with bipolar disorder (8.5\% [8.9\%]) or schizoaffective disorder  (9.4\%\,[8.1\%]), while 30-year cardiovascular risk was highest for patients with  schizoaffective disorder (44\% with 2 or more major cardiovascular risk factors,  compared to 40\% for patients with schizophrenia and 37\% for patients with bipolar  disorder). Smoking was highly prevalent (47\%), and mean (SD) BMI was 32.7 (7.9).  Conclusions: This CDS intervention produced a clinically and statistically  significant 4\% relative reduction in total modifiable cardiovascular risk for  intervention patients versus controls at 12 months, an effect observed across all  3 SMI subtypes and attributable to the aggregate impact of small changes in  multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

Diagnosis was confirmed by the intraperitoneal and intrapleural injection of radioisotope 99mTc-sulfur colloid that demonstrated the one-way transdiaphragmatic flow of fluid from the peritoneal to pleural cavities. In contrast, radioisotope injected into the peritoneal cavity of 5 patients with pleural effusions secondary to pulmonary or cardiac disease failed to traverse the diaphragm and localize in the pleural space. Medical therapy with salt and water restriction and diuretics resulted in both of the patients with hepatic hydrothorax developing signs of intravascular volume depletion without significant mobilization of the pleural fluid. Thoracotomy allowed identification of the diaphragmatic defects that were repaired by chemical and traumatic pleurodesis followed by postoperative peritoneal and pleural drainage. This therapy resulted in complete resolution of the pleural effusions, which have not recurred despite the subsequent development of clinical ascites in both patients.},

The aim of this study was to identify  psychological factors associated with pre-hospital delay (PHD) or patients'  decisional delay (PDD) in people with an ongoing AMI.

Thirty-six studies were included, involving 10.389 patients. Wrong  appraisal, interpretation and causal beliefs about symptoms, denial of the  severity of the symptoms and high levels of alexithymia were found related to  longer PHD or PDD. Alexithymia may be an overarching construct that explains the  disparate findings of the studies exploring the role of psychological factors in  PHD or PDD. Further studies are needed in order to analyse the role of  alexithymia in patients with risk factors for AMI to prevent delay.},

MCS typically follows a failure of less invasive maneuvers or intolerance to them, such as significant ventricular arrhythmia burden from inotropic support. MCS options include intra-aortic balloon pump, transvalvular percutaneous left ventricular assist devices, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and surgically implanted left ventricular assist devices. The number of MCS options has increased, and this has made the decision-making process complicated. MCS decision-making is complex, even in patients without valvular pathology. The presence of aortic valve (AV) abnormalities, such as aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, replaced AVs, or AV masses, adds even further to the challenge of selecting the appropriate support strategy. In this narrative review, a concise review of MCS options and the special considerations for various AV pathologies are presented.},

In this manuscript we develop diagnostic reasoning prompts to study whether LLMs can imitate clinical reasoning while accurately forming a diagnosis. We find that GPT-4 can be prompted to mimic the common clinical reasoning processes of clinicians without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. This is significant because an LLM that can imitate clinical reasoning to provide an interpretable rationale offers physicians a means to evaluate whether an LLMs response is likely correct and can be trusted for patient care. Prompting methods that use diagnostic reasoning have the potential to mitigate the ``black box'' limitations of LLMs, bringing them one step closer to safe and effective use in medicine.}

  abstract = {Background Prehospital activation of the cardiac catheter laboratory is associated with significant improvements in ST-segment-elevation myocardial  infarction (STEMI) performance measures. However, there are equivocal data,  particularly within Australia, regarding its influence on mortality. We assessed  the association of prehospital activation on performance measures and mortality  in patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention  from the Queensland Cardiac Outcomes Registry (QCOR). Methods and Results  Consecutive ambulance-transported patients with STEMI treated with primary  percutaneous coronary intervention were analyzed from January 1, 2017 to December  31, 2020 from the QCOR. The total and direct effects of prehospital activation on  the primary outcomes (30-day and 1-year cardiovascular mortality) were estimated  using logistic regression analyses. Secondary outcomes were STEMI performance  measures. Among 2498 patients (mean age: 62.2{\textpm}12.4\,years; 79.2\% male), 73\%  underwent prehospital activation. Median door-to-balloon time (34\,minutes [26-46]  versus 86\,minutes [68-113]; P{$<$}0.001), first-electrocardiograph-to-balloon time  (83.5\,minutes [72-98] versus 109\,minutes [81-139]; P{$<$}0.001), and proportion of  patients meeting STEMI targets (door-to-balloon {$<$}60\,minutes 90\% versus 16\%;  P{$<$}0.001), electrocardiograph-to-balloon time {$<$}90\,minutes (62\% versus 33\%;  P{$<$}0.001) were significantly improved with prehospital activation. Prehospital  activation was associated with significantly lower 30-day (1.6\% versus 6.6\%;  P{$<$}0.001) and 1-year cardiovascular mortality (2.9\% versus 9.5\%; P{$<$}0.001). After  adjustment, no prehospital activation was strongly associated with increased  30-day (odds ratio [OR], 3.6 [95\% CI, 2.2-6.0], P{$<$}0.001) and 1-year  cardiovascular mortality (OR, 3.0 [95\% CI, 2.0-4.6]; P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions  Prehospital activation of cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary  percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with significantly shorter time  to reperfusion, achievement of STEMI performance measures, and lower 30-day and  1-year cardiovascular mortality.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine  the prognostic value of various ECG presentations of acute myocardial ischemia.  DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the presenting ECGs of patients enrolled in  Global Use of Strategies To Open Occluded Arteries in Acute Coronary Syndromes  (GUSTO-IIb). SETTING: Three hundred seventy-three hospitals in 13 countries in  North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. PATIENTS: A total of 12142  patients who reported symptoms of cardiac ischemia at rest within 12 hours of  admission and had signs of myocardial ischemia confirmed by ECG. On presenting  ECG, 22\% of patients had T-wave inversion, 28\% had ST-segment elevation, 35\% had  ST-segment depression, and 15\% had a combination of ST-segment elevation and  depression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Ability of presenting ECG to predict death or  myocardial reinfarction during the first 30 days of follow-up. RESULTS: The  30-day incidence of death or myocardial reinfarction was 5.5\% in patients with  T-wave inversion, 9.4\% in those with ST-segment elevation, 10.5\% in those with  ST-segment depression, and 12.4\% in those with ST-segment elevation and  depression (P{$<$}.001). After adjusting for factors associated with an increased  risk of 30-day death or reinfarction, compared with those who had T-wave  inversion only, the odds of 30-day death or reinfarction were 1.68 (95\%  confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.08) in those with ST-segment elevation, 1.62  (95\% CI, 1.32-1.98) for those with ST-segment depression, and 2.27 (95\% CI,  1.80-2.86) for those with combined elevation and depression. An elevated creatine  kinase level at admission correlated with a higher risk of death (odds ratio  [OR], 2.36; 95\% CI, 1.92-2.91) and death or reinfarction (OR, 1.56; 95\% CI,  1.32-1.85). The ECG category and creatine kinase level at admission remained  highly predictive of death and myocardial infarction after multivariate  adjustment for the significant baseline predictors of events. CONCLUSIONS: The  ECG at presentation allows immediate risk stratification across the spectrum of  acute coronary syndromes. An elevated creatine kinase level at admission is  associated with worse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is a syndrome with different causes, characterised by clinical evidence of myocardial infarction with normal or near-normal coronary arteries on angiography. Its prevalence ranges between 5\% and 25\% of all myocardial infarction. The prognosis is extremely variable, depending on the cause of MINOCA. The key principle in the management of this syndrome is to clarify the underlying individual mechanisms to achieve patient-specific treatments. Clinical history, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography, coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography represent the first level diagnostic investigations to identify the causes of MINOCA. Regional wall motion abnormalities at left ventricular angiography limited to a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify an 'epicardial pattern'whereas regional wall motion abnormalities extended beyond a single epicardial coronary artery territory identify a 'microvascular pattern'. The most common causes of MINOCA are represented by coronary plaque disease, coronary dissection, coronary artery spasm, coronary microvascular spasm, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, coronary thromboembolism, other forms of type 2 myocardial infarction and MINOCA of uncertain aetiology. This review aims at summarising the diagnosis and management of MINOCA, according to the underlying physiopathology.},

  abstract = {Surgical treatment of tumors, epileptic foci or of vascular origin, requires a detailed individual pre-surgical workup and intra-operative surveillance of brain functions to minimize the risk of post-surgical neurological deficits and decline of quality of life. Most attention is attributed to language, motor functions, and perception. However, higher cognitive functions such as social cognition, personality, and the sense of self may be affected by brain surgery. To date, the precise localization and the network patterns of brain regions involved in such functions are not yet fully understood, making the assessment of risks of related post-surgical deficits difficult. It is in the interest of neurosurgeons to understand with which neural systems related to selfhood and personality they are interfering during surgery. Recent neuroscience research using virtual reality and clinical observations suggest that the insular cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporo-parietal junction are important components of a neural system dedicated to self-consciousness based on multisensory bodily processing, including exteroceptive and interoceptive cues (bodily self-consciousness (BSC)). Here, we argue that combined extra- and intra-operative approaches using targeted cognitive testing, functional imaging and EEG, virtual reality, combined with multisensory stimulations, may contribute to the assessment of the BSC and related cognitive aspects. Although the usefulness of particular biomarkers, such as cardiac and respiratory signals linked to virtual reality, and of heartbeat evoked potentials as a surrogate marker for intactness of multisensory integration for intra-operative monitoring has to be proved, systemic and automatized testing of BSC in neurosurgical patients will improve future surgical outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients at high-bleeding risk (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention represent a challenging patient population. The use of drug-coated balloon (DCB) allows shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy compared with drug-eluting stents (DES) and reduces thrombotic risk due to the absence of a permanent implant. The present analysis aimed to investigate if the effect of DCB versus DES differed between patients with and without HBR treated with percutaneous coronary intervention in small coronary arteries. METHODS: This prespecified subgroup analysis of a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial included 758 patients with de novo lesions in coronary vessels {$<$}3 mm and an indication for percutaneous coronary intervention, randomized to DCB (n=382) or second-generation DES (n=376). Patients were followed over 3 years for major adverse cardiac events. RESULTS: Of the 758 patients randomized, 155 (20\%) had HBR; these patients had higher mortality at 3 years (hazard ratio [95\% CI], 3.09 [1.78-5.36]; P{$<$}0.001). Rates of major bleeding events were overall low but tended to be lower after DCB versus DES (1.6\% versus 3.7\%; P=0.064), were similar in patients with HBR (4.5\% versus 3.4\%) but less frequent in DCB-versus DES-treated patients without HBR (0.9\% versus 3.8\%). There was no difference in major adverse cardiac events between DCB and DES regardless of bleeding risk (HBR, hazard ratio: 1.16 [0.51-2.62]; P=0.719 versus non-HBR, 0.96 [0.62-1.49]; P=0.863). CONCLUSIONS: DCBs were similarly safe and effective as current-generation DES in the treatment of coronary arteries {$<$}3 mm, regardless of bleeding risk. In patients treated with DCB, there was a trend towards a reduction of severe bleeding events at 3 years. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www. CLINICALTRIALS: gov; Unique identifier: NCT01574534.},

In contrast with the profound data regarding  the incidence and prognostic value of ventricular arrhythmias in ST elevation  myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients, data regarding contemporary non-ST  elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with ventricular arrhythmias is  scarce. The aim of the current study was to investigate the incidence of VF/VT  complicating NSTEMI among patients admitted to an intensive coronary care unit  (ICCU). Methods: Prospective, single-center study of patients diagnosed with  NSTEMI admitted to ICCU between June 2019 and December 2022. Data including  demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbid conditions, and physical examination,  as well as laboratory and imaging data, were analyzed. Patients were continuously  monitored for arrhythmias during their admission. The study endpoint was the  development of VF/sustained VT during admission. Results: A total of 732 patients  were admitted to ICCU with a diagnosis of NSTEMI. Of them, six (0.8\%) patients  developed VF/VT during their admission. Nevertheless, three were excluded after  they were misdiagnosed with NSTEMI instead of posterior ST elevation myocardial  infarction (STEMI). Hence, only three (0.4\%) NSTEMI patients had VF/VT during  admission. None of the patients died during 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: VF/VT  in NSTEMI patients treated according to contemporary guidelines including early  invasive strategy is rare, suggesting these patients may not need routine  monitoring and ICCU setup.},

  abstract = {Fentanyl is a synthetic, highly selective opioid with many desirable physicochemical properties, including a high lipophilicity and predictable pharmacokinetics. These properties have an established record in the management of pain in a variety of settings, particularly acute pain and breakthrough cancer pain. Fentanyl was initially developed for parenteral use; however, this is invasive and impractical in the outpatient setting. Unfortunately, the high first-pass metabolism of fentanyl makes oral formulations unfeasible. However, its high lipophilicity allows fentanyl to be absorbed via a number of other routes. Thus new formulations were designed to allow non-invasive methods of administration. Transmucosal and transdermal fentanyl formulations are well established, and have proven useful in the settings of breakthrough cancer pain, emergencies and in the paediatric population. The iontophoretic transdermal system was developed to provide a needle-free system of delivering bolus doses of fentanyl on demand, a novel way of delivering patient-controlled opioid analgesia. Transpulmonary administration of fentanyl remains experimental. The aim of this review is to provide an update on current non-parenteral fentanyl formulations, with attention to their particular pharmacokinetics and features relevant to clinical use in pain management.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To support development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults. METHODS: We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 8 clinical questions prioritized by a guideline panel from the Endocrine Society. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We reviewed 1949 citations, from which we included 21 studies. The risk of bias for most of the included studies was moderate. A higher proportion of patients who received bisphosphonate achieved resolution of hypercalcemia when compared to placebo. The incidence rate of adverse events was significantly higher in the bisphosphonate group. Comparing denosumab to bisphosphonate, there was no significant difference in the rate of patients who achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Two-thirds of patients with refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy who received denosumab following bisphosphonate therapy achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Addition of calcitonin to bisphosphonate therapy did not affect the resolution of hypercalcemia, time to normocalcemia, or hypocalcemia. Only indirect evidence was available to address questions on the management of hypercalcemia in tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy following the use of bisphosphonates, and the use of calcimimetics in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma. The certainty of the evidence to address all 8 clinical questions was low to very low. CONCLUSION: The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of treatments of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Additional information about patients' values and preferences, and other important decisional and contextual factors is needed to facilitate the development of clinical recommendations.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for decompensated liver disease, and by extension for hepatic hydrothorax. Persistent pleural effusions make it challenging for patients to maintain physiological fitness for transplantation. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) provide controlled pleural fluid removal, including peri-operatively. The immune dysfunction of cirrhosis heightens susceptibility to bacterial infection and concerns exist regarding the sepsis potential from a tunnelled drain. Method: Six patients were identified who underwent IPC insertion for hepatic hydrothorax before successful liver transplantation, between November 2016 and November 2017. Results: All patients had recurrent transudative right sided pleural effusions. Mean age was 49 years (range 24-64) and mean United Kingdom Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was 58. Four patients required correction of coagulopathy before insertion. There were no complications secondary to bleeding. Three patients were taught self-drainage at home of up to 1 litre (L) daily. A protocol was developed to ensure weekly review, pleural fluid culture and drainage of larger volumes in hospital. For every 2-3 L of pleural fluid drained, 100 mls of 20\% Human Albumin Solution (HAS) was administered. On average an IPC was in situ for 58 days before surgery and drained 19 L of fluid in hospital. There was a small increase in average BMI (0.2) and serum albumin (2.1 g/L) at transplantation. There was one episode of stage one acute kidney injury secondary to high volume drainage. No further ascitic or pleural procedures were needed while an IPC was in situ. One thoracentesis was required after IPC removal. On average IPCs remained in situ for 7 days post transplantation and drained a further 2 L of fluid. Pleural fluid sampling was acquired on 92\% of drainages in hospital. Of 44 fluid cultures, 2 cultured bacteria. Two patients had their IPCs and all other lines removed post transplantation due to suspected infection. Conclusion: Our case series describes a novel protocol and successful use of IPCs in the management of refractory hepatic hydrothorax as a bridge to liver transplantation. The protocol includes albumin replacement during pleural drainage, regular clinical review and culture of pleural fluid, with the option of self-drainage at home.},

There is some evidence to suggest that morphine may reduce the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single-center, randomized controlled trial, we compared the effect of morphine and fentanyl on platelet aggregation (PA) among patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor. Platelet aggregation was studied by automated light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) at baseline, and at 2~h after ticagrelor loading. The primary outcome was the difference in the maximal inhibition of platelet aggregation [IPA(\%)] between the groups at 2~h. Pain relief, and drug-related adverse events were secondary outcomes. Of 136 patients randomized, 70 received fentanyl and 66 received morphine. At baseline, the median (IQR) platelet aggregation [61.35\% (54.6 to 70) Vs. 58.8\% (52.7 to 72.9)] were comparable between the groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the fentanyl and the morphine groups in IPA at 2-h [85.88\%(64.65-98.16) and 81.93\%(44.2-98.03), p~=~0.09]. However, morphine use was independently associated with a PA of {$>$}30\% at 2~h (p~{$<~$}0.009). There was no difference in adverse events.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Balloon-expandable coronary-artery stents were developed to prevent coronary restenosis after coronary angioplasty. These devices hold coronary  vessels open at sites that have been dilated. However, it is unknown whether  stenting improves long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes as compared with  standard balloon angioplasty. METHODS: A total of 520 patients with stable angina  and a single coronary-artery lesion were randomly assigned to either stent  implantation (262 patients) or standard balloon angioplasty (258 patients). The  primary clinical end points were death, the occurrence of a cerebrovascular  accident, myocardial infarction, the need for coronary-artery bypass surgery, or  a second percutaneous intervention involving the previously treated lesion,  either at the time of the initial procedure or during the subsequent seven  months. The primary angiographic end point was the minimal luminal diameter at  follow-up, as determined by quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: After  exclusions, 52 patients in the stent group (20 percent) and 76 patients in the  angioplasty group (30 percent) reached a primary clinical end point (relative  risk, 0.68; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.92; P = 0.02). The  difference in clinical-event rates was explained mainly by a reduced need for a  second coronary angioplasty in the stent group (relative risk, 0.58; 95 percent  confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.85; P = 0.005). The mean (+/- SD) minimal luminal  diameters immediately after the procedure were 2.48 +/- 0.39 mm in the stent  group and 2.05 +/- 0.33 mm in the angioplasty group; at follow-up, the diameters  were 1.82 +/- 0.64 mm in the stent group and 1.73 +/- 0.55 mm in the angioplasty  group (P = 0.09), which correspond to rates of restenosis (diameter of stenosis,  {$>$} or = 50 percent) of 22 and 32 percent, respectively (P = 0.02). Peripheral  vascular complications necessitating surgery, blood transfusion, or both were  more frequent after stenting than after balloon angioplasty (13.5 vs. 3.1  percent, P {$<$} 0.001). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the stent  group than in the angioplasty group (8.5 vs. 3.1 days, P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:  Over seven months of follow-up, the clinical and angiographic outcomes were  better in patients who received a stent than in those who received standard  coronary angioplasty. However, this benefit was achieved at the cost of a  significantly higher risk of vascular complications at the access site and a  longer hospital stay.},

Eighteen doctors and twenty-one nurses  working in EDs and psychiatric liaisons teams in four general hospitals in the UK  were interviewed. Interviewees were asked about cases in which mental illness  interfered with diagnosis of physical problems and about other aspects of the  diagnostic process. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically.  Interviewees reported various scenarios in which mental illness or factors  related to it led to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment with various degrees of  seriousness. Direct factors which may lead to misattribution in this regard are  complex presentations or aspects related to poor communication or challenging  behaviour of the patient. Background factors are the crowded nature of the ED  environment, time pressures and targets and stigmatising attitudes held by a  minority of staff. The existence of psychiatric liaison team covering the ED  twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, can help reduce the risk of  misdiagnosis of people with mental illness who present with physical symptoms.  However, procedures used by emergency and psychiatric liaison staff require  fuller operationalization to reduce disagreement over where responsibilities lie.},

Bile leakage and stricture are the predominant complications. The reported incidence of biliary complications is 15\%-40\%, and these are known to occur more frequently in living donors than in deceased donors. Despite the absence of a confirmed therapeutic algorithm, many approaches have been used for treatment, including surgical, endoscopic, and percutaneous transhepatic techniques. In recent years, nonsurgical approaches have largely replaced reoperation. Among these, the endoscopic approach is currently the preferred initial treatment for patients who undergo duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction. Previously, endoscopic management was achieved most optimally through balloon dilatation and single or multiple stents placement. Recently, there have been significant developments in endoscopic devices, such as novel biliary stents, as well as advances in endoscopic technologies, including deep enteroscopy, the rendezvous technique, magnetic compression anastomosis, and direct cho\- langioscopy. These developments have resulted in almost all patients being managed by the endoscopic approach. Multiple recent publications suggest superior long-term results, with overall success rates ranging from 58\% to 75\%. This article summarizes the advances in endoscopic management of patients with biliary complications after LDLT.},

BACKGROUND: The scoring balloon angioplasty may play a pivotal role  in enhancing the outcomes of DCB treatment. METHODS: A total of 259 patients (278  lesions) with coronary artery disease successfully treated with DCB were  retrospectively enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 62.2 {\textpm} 11.1 years, and  the majority of patients were men (68.7\%). The study's endpoint was defined as  achieving an optimal angiographic result, which consisted of Thrombolysis in  Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3, residual diameter stenosis {$\leq$} 30\%, and  dissection less than type C after the procedure. RESULTS: Angioplasty was  performed for 61 lesions with a scoring balloon and 217 lesions with a  non-scoring balloon. All lesions were TIMI flow grade 3 except two lesions in the  non-scoring balloon group. The scoring balloon group had a higher prevalence of  residual diameter stenosis {$\leq$} 30\% (68.9\% vs. 39.6\%, p {$<$} 0.001), while severe  dissection, defined as type C or greater, was observed less frequently (9.8\% vs.  31.8\%, p = 0.001). Moreover, the scoring balloon group achieved a superior rate  of optimal angiographic results (60.7\% vs. 28.6\%, p {$<$} 0.001). In multivariable  analysis, scoring balloon (OR: 3.08 [95\% confidence interval, 1.47-6.58], p =  0.003) and DCB balloon-to-artery ratios (OR: 5.46 [95\% confidence interval,  1.43-21.93], p = 0.014) were independent factors in the increasing rate of  optimal angiographic result. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a scoring balloon  catheter for lesion preparation, aiming to make them suitable for DCB treatment,  was associated with a decreased risk of severe dissection and a greater  occurrence of optimal angiographic outcomes compared with non-scoring balloon  angioplasty.},

Plasma concentration of both compounds and platelet reactivity were evaluated in nine pre-defined time points within 6 hours after administration of ticagrelor loading dose. The results of our study show that mean platelet activity within the first hour was noticeably higher in metoclopramide-naive patients. Moreover, ticagrelor mean plasma concentration was significantly higher within the initial four time points (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes) in patients receiving metoclopramide (p\,=\,0.039; p\,=\,0.009; p\,=\,0.005; p\,=\,0.008, respectively). To conclude, the co-administration of metoclopramide in patients presenting with unstable angina and treated with morphine, has a beneficial effect on the PK/PD profile of ticagrelor and its metabolite; however, its impact on ST-elevation myocardial infarction patients requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of patients with de novo lesions in small coronary vessels undergoing percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) with drug-coated balloons (DCBs) or newer-generation  drug-eluting stents (n-DES). BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding the available evidence  from a few randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses, the best device for PCI  in patients with small-vessel coronary artery disease is not yet established.  METHODS: The study included all consecutive patients with de novo lesions in  small coronary vessels undergoing PCI in Sweden from April 2009 to July 2017. A  small coronary vessel was defined by a device diameter~{$\leq$}2.5~mm. The primary  outcomes were restenosis and definite target lesion thrombosis at 3-year  follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the occurrence of all-cause death and  myocardial infarction. RESULTS: The study population included 14,788 patients:  1,154 treated with DCBs and 13,634 with n-DES. Overall, 35,541 PCIs were  performed using 2,503 DCBs and 33,038 n-DES. The propensity score-adjusted  regression analysis showed a significantly higher risk for restenosis in the DCB  group compared with the n-DES group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.027; 95\%  confidence interval [CI]: 1.537 to 2.674). Conversely, no difference in the risk  for target lesion thrombosis (adjusted HR: 0.741; 95\%~CI: 0.412 to 1.331) was  detected. The risk for all-cause death (adjusted HR: 1.178; 95\%~CI: 0.992 to  1.399) and myocardial infarction (adjusted HR: 1.251; 95\%~CI: 0.960 to 1.629) was  comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the significantly higher risk  for restenosis up to 3 years, this research suggests that DCBs are not an equally  effective alternative to n-DES for percutaneous treatment of small coronary  vessels.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and~a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension,~reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model(1) (PaLM,~a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM(2) on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA(3), MedMCQA(4), PubMedQA(5) and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics(6)), including 67.6\% accuracy on MedQA~(US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17\%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.},

BACKGROUND: The use of MCS devices in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities undergoing TAVR is underexplored. METHODS: All patients undergoing TAVR at a single tertiary academic center who required MCS during index procedure between 2008 and 2015 were included in a prospective database. RESULTS: MCS was used in 9.4\% (54/577) of all TAVRs (n\,=\,52 Edwards Sapien and n\,=\,2 CoreValves) of which 68.5\% (n\,=\,37) were used as part of a planned strategy, and 31.5\% (n\,=\,17) were used in emergency "bail-out" situations. IABP was the most commonly used device (87\%) followed by Impella and ECMO (6\% each). Among the MCS group, 22\% required cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the procedure (n\,=\,4 elective [11\%] vs. n\,=\,8 emergent [47\%]) and 15\% upgrade to a second device (Impella or CPB after IABP; n\,=\,5 elective [14\%] vs. n\,=\,3 emergent [18\%]). Median duration of support was 1-day. Device related complications were low (4\%). In-hospital mortality in this extremely high-risk population was 24\% (13/54) (11\% [4/37] for elective cases and 53\% [9/17] for emergency cases). Cardiogenic shock (50\%) was the most common cause of in-hospital death. Cumulative all-cause 1-year mortality was 35\% (19/54) (19\% 97/370 for elective and 71\% [12/17] for emergency cases). CONCLUSION: Emergent use of MCS during TAVR in extremely high-risk population is associated with high short and long-term mortality rates. Early identification of patients at risk for hemodynamic compromise may rationalize elective utilization of MCS during TAVR.},

Ideally, liver transplantation is the best treatment option; however, most of the patients are not candidates and most of those who are eligible die while waiting for a transplant.

The aim of this study was to determine the practice and inhospital outcomes of MCS utilization in patients undergoing TAVI. We analyzed data from Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2011 and 2012) using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. A total of 1,794 TAVI procedures (375 hospitals in the United States) were identified of which 190 (10.6\%) used an MCS device (MCS group) and 1,604 (89.4\%) did not (non-MCS group). The use of MCS devices with TAVI was associated with significant increase in the inhospital mortality (14.9\% vs 3.5\%, p {$<$}0.01). The mean length (11.8 {\textpm} 0.8 vs 8.1 {\textpm} 0.2 days, p {$<$}0.01) and cost (\$68,997 {\textpm} 3,656 vs \$55,878 {\textpm} 653, p = 0.03) of hospitalization were also significantly greater in the MCS group. Ventricular fibrillation arrest, transapical access for TAVI, and cardiogenic shock were the most significant predictors of MCS use during TAVI. In the multivariate model, use of any MCS device was found to be an independent predictor of increased mortality (odds ratio 3.5, 95\% confidence interval 2.6 to 4.6, p {$<$}0.0001) and complications (odds ratio 3.3, 95\% confidence interval 2.8 to 3.9, p {$<$}0.0001). The propensity score-matched analysis also showed a similar result. In conclusion, the unacceptably high rates of mortality and complications coupled with a significant increase in the length and cost of hospitalization should raise concerns about utility of MCS devices during TAVI in this prohibitive surgical risk population.},

RESULTS: A significant increase in urinary volume, urinary sodium excretion, mean arterial pressure, and decrease in plasma renin activity (p{$<$}0.05) was noted after 1 month of midodrine administration. There was also a significant decrease in cardiac output and an increase in systemic vascular resistance after midodrine therapy at 3 months (p{$<$}0.05). There was no change in glomerular filtration rate and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Midodrine plus standard medical therapy was significantly superior to standard medical therapy alone in the control of ascites (p=0.013) at 3 months. The mortality rate in the standard medical therapy group was significantly higher than the midodrine group (p{$<$}0.046). There was no significant difference in the frequency of various complications at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this randomized pilot study suggest that midodrine plus standard medical therapy improves the systemic hemodynamics without any renal or hepatic dysfunction in these patients and is superior to standard medical therapy alone for the control of ascites.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The management of patients with severe aortic stenosis who go on to develop left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock remains an important clinical challenge associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Once considered a relative contraindication, the use of Impella in severe aortic stenosis has now been proven feasible and demonstrated promising results in selected high-risk patients. The use of Impella to provide hemodynamic support maybe considered in patients with aortic stenosis in cardiogenic shock or those with severe left ventricular dysfunction and CAD who require high-risk PCI and or balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Impella is also an attractive option in selected cases of hemodynamic collapse during TAVR.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prognostic differences between anterior and inferior wall Myocardial Infarction (MI) has been extensively investigated, but there is  limited information about similar comparison between inferior wall MI caused by  right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCX) occlusion. The aim  of present study was to compare prognostic differences between LCX- and  RCA-related acute inferior wall ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) treated by  routine adjunctive angioplasty after receiving thrombolytic therapy (TLT).  METHODS: Between March 2012 and June 2013 one hundred fifty consecutive patients  with acute inferior wall STEMI were studied. Patients were divided into two  groups according to the infarct related artery (LCX vs. RCA). All patients  underwent routine adjunctive angioplasty after TLT during the index  hospitalization and clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared. RESULTS:  RCA and LCX arteries were occluded in 97 (64.7\%) and 53 (35.3\%) of patients,  respectively. Two groups were similar in baseline characteristics except  multiple-vessel disease was more prevalent with LCX occlusion (p= 0.008). There  was a higher cardiac enzyme release (p{$<$} 0.001), more significant mitral  regurgitation (MR) (p= 0.015), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF) (p= 0.01) in patients with LCX occlusion. Multivariate analysis showed  cTn-I release, occurrence of MR, and lower LVEF as independent factors leading to  poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There were higher cTn-I release, MR occurrence, and  lower LVEF in LCX-related acute inferior wall STEMI, all associated with poor  outcome. Therefore, patients with ECG finding in favour of LCX occlusion should  be considered as high risk and an invasive approach should be planned.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Second generation of drug eluting stents (DES) has attempted to improve safety using abluminal sirolimus drug delivery with biodegradable  polymers matrix. The present preclinical study was designed to investigate the  safety and efficacy profile of Abluminus™ stents (SES). This is a new coronary  stent with sirolimus and biodegradable polymer matrix coated on abluminal stent  and balloon surface. METHODS: SES were compared with two controls: bare metal  stent (BMS) and BMS + polymer coated stents (PC). All devices (40 stents) were  implanted in porcine coronary arteries with primary endpoint of  endothelialization at 7 days and subsequent histological and morphometric  evaluations at 7, 30 and 90 days. RESULTS: Early endothelialization at seven days  was complete in all stents. Histology at 30 days revealed minimum inflammation in  all groups and increased at 90 days in PC group while it was absent at 180 days.  Thirty day morphometry showed significantly reduction of neointimal area in  Abluminus™ (SES 0.96{\textpm}0.48 mm(2); BMS 1.83{\textpm}0.34 mm(2); PC 1.76{\textpm}0.55 mm(2);  P{$<$}0.05); after 90 days neointimal area was 1.10{\textpm}0.54 mm(2) for SES; 1.92{\textpm}0.36  mm(2) for BMS; and 1.94{\textpm}0.48 mm(2) for PC; P{$<$}0.05). Neointimal thickness at 30  and 90 days respectively was 0.15{\textpm}0.07 and 0.18{\textpm}0.10 mm for SES, 0.57{\textpm}0.08 and  0.61{\textpm}0.09 mm for BMS and 0.52{\textpm}0.09 and 0.59{\textpm}0.08 mm, P{$<$}0.001 for PC group.  CONCLUSIONS: The most significant experimental evidence appears to be earlier  endothelialization at 7 days for SES which led to safety of the device. Efficacy  of the device was also observed by a reduced neointimal thickness and minimized  inflammatory score at all follow-ups. Termination of antiplatelet at 30 days has  not shown any further complications. Polymer thickness was almost in negligible  amount at 180 days with no inflammation.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Angiography has limited value for identifying the causes of stent thrombosis (ST). We studied a large cohort of patients by optical coherence tomography (OCT) to explore ST characteristics and mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective multicentre registry was screened for patients with confirmed ST. Optical coherence tomography was performed after initial intervention to the culprit lesion (in 69\% of cases in a deferred procedure). Stent thrombosis was classified as acute (AST), sub-acute (SAST), late (LST), and very late (VLST). Optical coherence tomography records were analysed in a central core lab. The analysis included 120 subjects aged 61.7 [51.4-70.7]; 89\% male. Very late ST was the clinical presentation in 75\%, LST in 6\%, SAST in 15\%, and AST in 4\% of patients. Bare metal stents (BMS) were used in 39\%, drug-eluting stents (DES) in 59\% and bioresorbable vascular scaffolds in 2\% of the cases. Optical coherence tomography identified an underlying morphological abnormality in 97\% of cases, including struts malapposition (34\%), neoatherosclerotic lesions (22\%), major stent underexpansion (11\%), coronary evagination (8\%), isolated uncovered struts (8\%), edge-related disease progression (8\%), and neointimal hyperplasia (4\%). Ruptured neoatherosclerotic lesions were more frequent with BMS than with DES (36 vs. 14\%, P = 0.005), whereas coronary evaginations were more frequent with DES than with BMS (12 vs. 2\%, P = 0.04). LST + VLST were mainly related to malapposition (31\%) and neoatherosclerosis (28\%), while prominent mechanisms for AST + SAST were malapposition (48\%) and underexpansion (26\%). CONCLUSION: In patients with confirmed ST, OCT imaging identified an underlying morphological abnormality in 97\% of cases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug eluting stents (DES) are associated with a 2\% to 4\% annual rate of target lesion failure through 5-to-10-year follow-up. The presence of a  metallic protheses is a trigger for neo-atherosclerosis and very late stent  thrombosis. A "leave nothing behind" strategy using Drug Coated Balloons has been  suggested; however, paclitaxel coated balloons are only recommended in selected  indications. Recently a novel sirolimus eluting balloon, the SELUTION SLR (TM)  014 PTCA balloon (SEB) (M.A. MedAlliance SA, Nyon, Switzerland) has been  developed. HYPOTHESIS: A strategy of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)  with SEB and provisional DES is non-inferior to a strategy of systematic DES on  target vessel failure (TVF) at one and five years. If non-inferiority is met at 5  years, superiority will be tested. DESIGN: SELUTION DeNovo is a multi-center  international open-label randomized trial. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria  are randomized 1:1 to treatment of all lesions with either SEB and provisional  DES or systematic DES. Major inclusion criteria are PCI indicated for {$\geq$}1 lesion  considered suitable for treatment by either SEB or DES and clinical presentation  with chronic coronary syndrome, unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation  myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). There is no limitation in the number of lesions  to be treated. Target lesions diameters are between 2 and 5 mm. Major exclusion  criteria are lesions in the left main artery, chronic total occlusions, ST  segment elevation myocardial infarction and unstable non-ST segment elevation  myocardial infarction. Three thousand three hundred twenty six patients will be  included in 50 sites in Europe and Asia. TVF rates and their components will be  determined at 30 days, 6 months and annually up to 5 years post-intervention.  Among secondary endpoints, bleeding events, cost-effectiveness data and net  clinical benefits will be assessed. SUMMARY: SELUTION DeNovo trial is an  open-label, multi-center international randomized trial comparing a strategy of  PCI with SEB and provisional DES to a strategy of PCI with systematic DES on TVF  at one and five years. Non-inferiority will be tested at one and five years. If  non-inferiority is met at five years, superiority will be tested.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary results of the HORIZONS-AMI trial have been previously reported. In this final report, we aimed to assess 3-year outcomes. METHODS: HORIZONS-AMI was a prospective, open-label, randomised trial undertaken at 123 institutions in 11 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older were eligible for enrolment if they had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), presented within 12 h after onset of symptoms, and were undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. By use of a computerised interactive voice response system, we randomly allocated patients 1:1 to receive bivalirudin or heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI; pharmacological randomisation; stratified by previous and expected drug use and study site) and, if eligible, randomly allocated 3:1 to receive a paclitaxel-eluting stent or a bare metal stent (stent randomisation; stratified by pharmacological group assignment, diabetes mellitus status, lesion length, and study site). We produced Kaplan-Meier estimates of major adverse cardiovascular events at 3 years by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00433966. FINDINGS: Compared with 1802 patients allocated to receive heparin plus a GPI, 1800 patients allocated to bivalirudin monotherapy had lower rates of all-cause mortality (5{$\cdot$}9\%vs 7{$\cdot$}7\%, difference -1{$\cdot$}9\% [-3{$\cdot$}5 to -0{$\cdot$}2], HR 0{$\cdot$}75 [0{$\cdot$}58-0{$\cdot$}97]; p=0{$\cdot$}03), cardiac mortality (2{$\cdot$}9\%vs 5{$\cdot$}1\%, -2{$\cdot$}2\% [-3{$\cdot$}5 to -0{$\cdot$}9], 0{$\cdot$}56 [0{$\cdot$}40-0{$\cdot$}80]; p=0{$\cdot$}001), reinfarction (6{$\cdot$}2\%vs 8{$\cdot$}2\%, -1{$\cdot$}9\% [-3{$\cdot$}7 to -0{$\cdot$}2], 0{$\cdot$}76 [0{$\cdot$}59-0{$\cdot$}99]; p=0{$\cdot$}04), and major bleeding not related to bypass graft surgery (6{$\cdot$}9\%vs 10{$\cdot$}5\%, -3{$\cdot$}6\% [-5{$\cdot$}5 to -1{$\cdot$}7], 0{$\cdot$}64 [0{$\cdot$}51-0{$\cdot$}80]; p=0{$\cdot$}0001) at 3 years, with no significant differences in ischaemia-driven target vessel revascularisation, stent thrombosis, or composite adverse events. Compared with 749 patients who received a bare-metal stent, 2257 patients who received a paclitaxel-eluting stent had lower rates of ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation (9{$\cdot$}4\%vs 15{$\cdot$}1\%, -5{$\cdot$}7\% [-8{$\cdot$}6 to -2{$\cdot$}7], 0{$\cdot$}60 [0{$\cdot$}48-0{$\cdot$}76]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) after 3 years, with no significant differences in the rates of death, reinfarction, stroke or stent thrombosis. Stent thrombosis was high ({$\geq$}4{$\cdot$}5\%) in both groups. INTERPRETATION: The effectiveness and safety of bivalirudin monotherapy and paclitaxel-eluting stenting are sustained at 3 years for patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This randomized study compared denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor {$\kappa$} B (RANK) ligand, with zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg and intravenous placebo (n = 1,026) or intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg adjusted for creatinine clearance and subcutaneous placebo (n = 1,020) every 4 weeks. All patients were strongly recommended to take daily calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary end point was time to first on-study SRE (defined as pathologic fracture, radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression). RESULTS: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying time to first on-study SRE (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 0.95; P = .01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent (multiple) on-study SREs (rate ratio, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; P = .001). Reduction in bone turnover markers was greater with denosumab. Overall survival, disease progression, and rates of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were similar between groups. An excess of renal AEs and acute-phase reactions occurred with zoledronic acid; hypocalcemia occurred more frequently with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred infrequently (2.0\%, denosumab; 1.4\%, zoledronic acid; P = .39). CONCLUSION: Denosumab was superior to zoledronic acid in delaying or preventing SREs in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone and was generally well tolerated. With the convenience of a subcutaneous injection and no requirement for renal monitoring, denosumab represents a potential treatment option for patients with bone metastases.},

Several studies identify  barriers that can affect participation in CR among patients with CHD after  reperfusion therapy. However, there has yet to be a review specifically in this  population.~This review aims to identify the literature systematically that  analyzes the barriers that affect the participation of CHD patients after  reperfusion therapy in implementing the CR program.~This study used the Preferred  Reporting Item for PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) with  databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, EBSCO-hosted Academic Search Complete, Scopus,  Taylor \& Francis, and Sage Journals. The keywords used in English were "coronary  artery disease OR myocardial infarction OR cardiovascular disease OR heart  disease" AND "Barrier OR obstacle", AND "percutaneous coronary intervention OR  PCI OR angioplasty OR coronary artery bypass graft surgery OR CABG" AND "cardiac  rehabilitation OR rehabilitation OR recovery". The inclusion criteria in this  review were full-text articles in English, articles with a descriptive,  cross-sectional, and cohort design with a minimum of 100 participants that  discussed barriers to participation in patients with CHD after undergoing  reperfusion therapy, and the CR phases such as I, II, III, and IV have also been  identified. Based on the initial search, there are 23 relevant studies out of  7400. The results of this study reported that most of the participants from the  studies analyzed had a low level of participation in CR ({$\leq$}50\%). We classify the  factors that affect the level of CR participation into five categories:  individual factors, health history, environmental, logistical, and health  system.~The most reported barriers in each category were age, comorbidities, lack  of support from friends, family and health workers, distance or travel time, and  cost and economic status. Professional health workers, especially nurses, can  identify various barriers that patients feel so that they can increase their  participation in attending CR.},

  abstract = {Recent studies showed that preoperative functional assessment with fractional flow reserve (FFR) could predict a long-term patency of arterial bypass grafts in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel angiography-based approach to estimate FFR. This study aimed to investigate whether preoperative QFR could discriminate arterial bypass function at 1~year after surgery. The PRIDE-METAL registry was a prospective, multicenter observational study that enrolled 54 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. By protocol, left coronary stenoses were revascularized by CABG with arterial grafts, whereas right coronary stenoses were treated with coronary stenting. Follow-up angiography at 1~year after surgery was scheduled to assess arterial graft patency. QFR was performed using index angiography by certified analysts, blinded to bypass graft function. The primary end point of this sub-study was the discriminative ability of QFR for arterial graft function, as assessed by receiver-operating characteristic curve. Among 54 patients enrolled in the PRIDE-METAL registry, index and follow-up angiography was available in 41 patients with 97 anastomoses. QFR were analyzed in 35 patients (71 anastomoses) with an analyzability of 85.5\% (71/83). Five bypass grafts were found to be non-functional at 1~year. The diagnostic performance of QFR was substantial (area under the curve: 0.89; 95\% confidence interval: 0.83 to 0.96) with an optimal cutoff of 0.76 to predict functionality of bypass grafts. Preoperative QFR is highly discriminative for predicting postoperative arterial graft function.Trial registration: Clinical.gov reference: NCT02894255.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether screening for atrial fibrillation and subsequent treatment with anticoagulants if atrial fibrillation is detected can prevent stroke. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring using an implantable loop recorder (ILR) can facilitate detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation episodes. We aimed to investigate whether atrial fibrillation screening and use of anticoagulants can prevent stroke in individuals at high risk. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial in four centres in Denmark. We included individuals without atrial fibrillation, aged 70-90 years, with at least one additional stroke risk factor (ie, hypertension, diabetes, previous stroke, or heart failure). Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:3 ratio to ILR monitoring or usual care (control) via an online system in permuted blocks with block sizes of four or eight participants stratified according to centre. In the ILR group, anticoagulation was recommended if atrial fibrillation episodes lasted 6 min or longer. The primary outcome was time to first stroke or systemic arterial embolism. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02036450. FINDINGS: From Jan 31, 2014, to May 17, 2016, 6205 individuals were screened for inclusion, of whom 6004 were included and randomly assigned: 1501 (25{$\cdot$}0\%) to ILR monitoring and 4503 (75{$\cdot$}0\%) to usual care. Mean age was 74{$\cdot$}7 years (SD 4{$\cdot$}1), 2837 (47{$\cdot$}3\%) were women, and 5444 (90{$\cdot$}7\%) had hypertension. No participants were lost to follow-up. During a median follow-up of 64{$\cdot$}5 months (IQR 59{$\cdot$}3-69{$\cdot$}8), atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 1027 participants: 477 (31{$\cdot$}8\%) of 1501 in the ILR group versus 550 (12{$\cdot$}2\%) of 4503 in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 3{$\cdot$}17 [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}81-3{$\cdot$}59]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Oral anticoagulation was initiated in 1036 participants: 445 (29{$\cdot$}7\%) in the ILR group versus 591 (13{$\cdot$}1\%) in the control group (HR 2{$\cdot$}72 [95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}41-3{$\cdot$}08]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and the primary outcome occurred in 318 participants (315 stroke, three systemic arterial embolism): 67 (4{$\cdot$}5\%) in the ILR group versus 251 (5{$\cdot$}6\%) in the control group (HR 0{$\cdot$}80 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}61-1{$\cdot$}05]; p=0{$\cdot$}11). Major bleeding occurred in 221 participants: 65 (4{$\cdot$}3\%) in the ILR group versus 156 (3{$\cdot$}5\%) in the control group (HR 1{$\cdot$}26 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}95-1{$\cdot$}69]; p=0{$\cdot$}11). INTERPRETATION: In individuals with stroke risk factors, ILR screening resulted in a three-times increase in atrial fibrillation detection and anticoagulation initiation but no significant reduction in the risk of stroke or systemic arterial embolism. These findings might imply that not all atrial fibrillation is worth screening for, and not all screen-detected atrial fibrillation merits anticoagulation.

We aim to describe the in vivo  experimental result of a new polymer-free DES eluting sirolimus from  stent-plus-balloon (Focus np stent, Envision Scientific) compared with a  bare-metal stent (BMS) (Amazonia CroCo, Minvasys) and with a biolimus A9 eluting  stent (Biomatrix, Biosensors). METHODS: In 10 juvenile pigs, 23 coronary stents  were implanted in the coronary arteries (8 Amazonia CroCo, 8 Focus np, and 7  Biomatrix). At 28-day follow-up, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histology  were used to evaluate neointimal hyperplasia and healing response. RESULTS:  According to OCT analysis, Focus np stents had a greater lumen area and less  neointimal hyperplasia response than BMS and Biomatrix had. Histomorphometry  results showed less neointimal hyperplasia in Focus np than in BMS. Histology  showed a higher fibrin deposition in Biomatrix stent compared to Focus np and  BMS. CONCLUSIONS: The new polymer-free DES with sirolimus eluted from  stent-plus-balloon demonstrated safety and reduced neointimal proliferation  compared with the BMS and Biomatrix stents at 28-day follow-up in this porcine  coronary model. This new polymer-free DES is promising and warrants further  clinical studies.},

HYPOTHESIS: Post-procedural QFR is related to  adverse events in patients undergoing DCB angioplasty for ISR lesions. METHODS:  This retrospective study included data from patients undergoing DCB angioplasty  for drug-eluting stent (DES) ISR between January 2016 and February 2019. The QFR  was measured at baseline and after DCB angioplasty. The endpoint was the  vessel-oriented composite endpoint (VOCE), defined as a composite of cardiac  death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven target vessel  revascularization. RESULTS: Overall, 177 patients with 185 DES-ISR lesions were  included. During 1-year follow-up, 27 VOCEs occurred in 26 patients. The area  under curve (AUC) of the post-procedural QFR was statistically greater than that  of the in-stent percent diameter stenosis (0.77, 95\% confidence interval [CI]  0.67-0.87 vs. 0.64, 95\% CI 0.53-0.75; p = .032). Final QFR cutoff of 0.94 has the  best predictive accuracy for VOCE. A QFR {$>$}\,0.94 was associated with a lower risk  of VOCE compared to a QFR {$\leq$}\,0.94 (log-rank test, p {$<$} .0001). Survival analysis  using the multivariable Cox model showed that a post-procedural QFR {$\leq$}\,0.94 was an  independent predictor of 1-year VOCE (hazard ratio 6.53, 95\% CI 2.70-15.8, p {$<$}  .001). CONCLUSIONS: A lower QFR value was associated with worse clinical outcomes  at 1 year after DCB angioplasty for DES-ISR.},

  abstract = {Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor blocker is a key strategy to reduce platelet reactivity and to prevent thrombotic events in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. In an earlier consensus document, we proposed cutoff values for high on-treatment platelet reactivity to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) associated with post-percutaneous coronary intervention ischemic events for various platelet function tests (PFTs). Updated American and European practice guidelines have issued a Class IIb recommendation for PFT to facilitate the choice of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor in selected high-risk patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, although routine testing is not recommended (Class III). Accumulated data from large studies underscore the importance of high on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP as a prognostic risk factor. Recent prospective randomized trials of PFT did not demonstrate clinical benefit, thus questioning whether treatment modification based on the results of current PFT platforms can actually influence outcomes. However, there are major limitations associated with these randomized trials. In addition, recent data suggest that low on-treatment platelet reactivity to ADP is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, a therapeutic window concept has been proposed for P2Y12 inhibitor therapy. In this updated consensus document, we review the available evidence addressing the relation of platelet reactivity to thrombotic and bleeding events.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of the microaxial percutaneous mechanical circulatory support device (Impella{\textregistered} pump) implantation pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus during/after PCI in cardiogenic shock (CS) and high-risk PCI populations. BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the safety and effectiveness of the Impella and the role of timing of this support initiation in specific clinical settings is of utmost clinical relevance. METHODS: A total of 365 patients treated with Impella 2.5/CP in the 17 centers of the IMP-IT Registry were included. Through propensity-score weighting (PSW) analysis, 1-year clinical outcomes were assessed separately in CS and HR-PCI patients, stratified by timing of Impella support. RESULTS: Pre-procedural insertion was associated with an improvement in 1-year survival in patients with CS due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated with PCI (p~=~.04 before PSW, p~=~.009 after PSW) and HR-PCI (p\,{$<$}\,.01 both before and after PSW). Among patients undergoing HR-PCI, early Impella support was also associated with a lower rate of the composite of mortality, re-hospitalization for heart failure, and need for left-ventricular assist device/heart transplantation at 1-year (p~=~.04 before PSW, p~=~.01 after PSW). Furthermore, Impella use during/after PCI was associated with an increased in-hospital life-threatening and severe bleeding among patients with AMI-CS receiving PCI (7 vs. 16\%, p~=~.1) and HR-PCI (1 vs. 9\%, p~=~.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested a survival benefit and reduced rates of major bleeding when a pre-PCI Impella implantation instead of during-after procedure was used in the setting of HR-PCI and AMI-CS.},

The aim of this trial was to examine the effect of intravenous (iv) acetaminophen compared with iv fentanyl on P2Y12 receptor inhibition in patients with STEMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Opioids aNd crushed Ticagrelor In Myocardial infarction Evaluation (ON-TIME 3) trial randomized 195 STEMI patients who were scheduled to undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were pre-treated with crushed ticagrelor to iv acetaminophen (N = 98) or iv fentanyl (N = 97) in the ambulance. The primary endpoint, consisting of the level of platelet reactivity units (PRU) measured immediately after primary PCI, was not significantly different between the study arms [median PRU 104 (IQR 37-215) vs. 175 (63-228), P = 0.18]. However, systemic levels of ticagrelor were significantly higher in the acetaminophen arm at the start of primary PCI [151 ng/mL (32-509) vs. 60 ng/mL (13-206), P = 0.007], immediately after primary PCI [326 ng/mL (94-791) vs. 115 ng/mL (38-326), P = 0.002], and at 1 h after primary PCI [488 ng/mL (281-974) vs. 372 ng/mL (95-635), P = 0.002]. Acetaminophen resulted in the same extent of pain relief when compared with fentanyl [reduction of 3 points on 10-step-pain scale before primary PCI (IQR 1-5)] in both study arms (P = 0.67) and immediately after PCI [reduction of 5 points (3-7); P = 0.96]. CONCLUSION: The iv acetaminophen in comparison with iv fentanyl was not associated with significantly lower platelet reactivity in STEMI patients but resulted in significantly higher ticagrelor plasma levels and was effective in pain relief.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ticagrelor is a direct-acting, reversibly-binding, oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist. It demonstrates predictable, linear pharmacokinetics. Two studies were undertaken to further elucidate the absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor and its regional absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. DESIGN AND METHODS: In two open-label, randomized, cross-over studies, 12 volunteers received a single dose of ticagrelor: oral 90\,mg and 15\,mg IV (Study 1); or 100\,mg oral suspension vs 100\,mg immediate release (IR) tablet (Study 2). After the initial cross-over period in Study 2, patients received 100\,mg suspension delivered to specific sites in the GI tract using an Enterion capsule. In both studies, plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX were measured following administration of each formulation. RESULTS: The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was 36\% (95\% confidence interval\,=\,30-42\%). Metabolite:parent ratios were higher after oral administration, compared with IV administration (maximum plasma concentration [C max]\,=\,0.356 and 0.037; area under the plasma concentration-time curves [AUC]\,=\,0.530 and 0.173, respectively). Following oral administration of the 100\,mg IR tablet, the AUC and C max of ticagrelor were 78\% and 58\%, respectively, of those following oral administration of the 100\,mg suspension. Exposure to ticagrelor decreased the further down the GI tract it was released: mean C max for ticagrelor was 91\%, 68\%, and 13\% that for the oral suspension when released in the proximal small bowel, distal small bowel and ascending colon, respectively; mean AUCs were 89\%, 73\%, and 32\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mean absolute bioavailability of ticagrelor was 36\% and the proportion of ticagrelor absorbed decreased the further down the GI tract it was released: the mean AUC for ticagrelor was 89\% (proximal small bowel), 73\% (distal small bowel), and 32\% (ascending colon) that of the mean AUC for the orally administered suspension.},

In the context of coronary artery disease (CAD), PPIs are commonly prescribed along with antiplatelet medications. In fact, the potential interaction between these two classes of medications has been subject to much debate. This review aimed to summarise the findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the casual relationship between PPI use (alone) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Furthermore, the recent release of ChatGPT has provided reviewers with a powerful natural language processing tool. We therefore aimed to assess the utility of ChatGPT in the systematic review process. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed was conducted to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses published up to March 2023. Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality using AMSTAR 2.0. The population of interest was adults that received the medications of interest (PPIs) for a minimum of three months, regardless of indication. Control groups were defined as placebo or active comparators. The outcomes of interest were described under the general term MACE, which include cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. There were no restrictions with regards to time, but we only included reports in English. A different group of independent reviewers simultaneously ran the same process using ChatGPT. The results were then compared with the human generated results. RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included, involving a total of 46 randomised controlled trials and 33 observational studies. The studies examined the association between PPI use and MACE, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality. The results of the individual studies were conflicting, with some showing a positive association between PPI use and MACE, some showing no association, and others showing mixed results. However, the majority of the studies that included observational data reported a positive association between PPI use and MACE. Sensitivity analyses conducted in some studies did not significantly alter the primary results, suggesting that the findings were robust. Furthermore, ChatGPT was successfully prompted to execute most tasks involved in this review. We therefore present text that was generated by ChatGPT, including the abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections. CONCLUSION: The findings of this umbrella review suggest that a causal relationship between PPI use and an increased risk of MACE cannot be ruled out. Further research is needed to better understand this relationship, particularly the underlying mechanisms and potential confounding factors. Healthcare professionals should consider the long-term use of PPIs and carefully weigh the risks and benefits for each patient. Finally, ChatGPT was successfully prompted to execute most of the tasks involved in this review. We therefore feel that this tool will be of great assistance in the field of evidence synthesis in the near future.},

We sought to investigate the predictive value of  the angiography-derived FFR for adverse cardiovascular events in patients after  PCI. We conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, MEDLINE,  EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, for studies published until March 2023 that  investigated the prognostic role of angiography-derived fractional flow reserve  values after PCI. We investigated the best predictive ability of the post-PCI  angiography-derived FFR and relative risk (RR) estimates with 95\% confidence  intervals (CIs) between post-PCI angiography-derived FFR values and adverse  events. Thirteen cohort studies involving 6961 patients (9719 vascular lesions;  mean follow-up: 2.2 years) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled HR of  the studies using specific cut-off points for post-PCI angiography-derived FFR  was 4.13 (95\% CI, 2.92-5.82) for total cardiovascular events, while the pooled  HRs for target vessel revascularization, cardiac death, target vessel myocardial  infarction, and target lesion revascularization were 6.87 (95\% CI, 4.93-9.56),  6.17 (95\% CI, 3.52-10.80), 3.98 (95\% CI, 2.37-6.66) and 6.27 (95\% CI,  3.08-12.79), respectively. In a sensitivity analysis of three studies with 1789  patients assessing the predictive role of the post-PCI angiography-derived FFR as  a continuous variable, we found a 58\% risk reduction for future adverse events  per 0.1 increase in the post-PCI angiography-derived FFR value. In conclusion,  post-PCI angiography-derived FFR is an effective tool for predicting adverse  cardiovascular events and could be potentially used in decision making, both  during PCI and in the long-term follow-up.},

OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the association between system delay and the risk for readmissions or  outpatient contacts due to CHF after primary percutaneous coronary intervention  (PPCI) in patients with STEMI. DESIGN: Historical follow-up study using  population-based medical registries. SETTING: Western Denmark. PATIENTS: Patients  with STEMI who were transported by emergency medical service from 1 January 1999  to 7 February 2010 and treated with PPCI within 12 hours of symptom onset and who  had a system delay of 6 hours or less (n = 7952). The median duration of  follow-up was 3.1 years. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative incidence of readmissions or  outpatient contacts due to CHF was determined by using competing-risk regression  analysis, with death as the competing risk. Crude and adjusted cause-specific  hazard ratios for readmissions or outpatient contacts due to CHF were determined  for system delay and other covariates. RESULTS: System delays of 60 minutes or  less (n = 451), 61 to 120 minutes (n = 3457), 121 to 180 minutes (n = 2655), and  181 to 360 minutes (n = 1389) corresponded with long-term risks for readmissions  or outpatient contacts due to CHF of 10.1\%, 10.6\%, 12.3\%, and 14.1\%, respectively  (P {$<$} 0.001). In multivariable analysis, system delay was an independent predictor  of readmissions or outpatient contacts due to CHF (adjusted hazard ratio per hour  increase in delay, 1.10 [95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.17]). LIMITATION: In any nonrandomized  study, there are risks for selection bias and residual confounding.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Timely reperfusion therapy is recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and door-to-balloon delay has been  proposed as a performance measure in triaging patients for primary percutaneous  coronary intervention (PCI). However, focusing on the time from first contact  with the health care system to the initiation of reperfusion therapy (system  delay) may be more relevant, because it constitutes the total time to reperfusion  modifiable by the health care system. No previous studies have focused on the  association between system delay and outcome in patients with STEMI treated with  primary PCI. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between system, treatment,  patient, and door-to-balloon delays and mortality in patients with STEMI. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Historical follow-up study based on population-based  Danish medical registries of patients with STEMI transported by the emergency  medical service and treated with primary PCI from January 1, 2002, to December  31, 2008, at 3 high-volume PCI centers in Western Denmark. Patients (N = 6209)  underwent primary PCI within 12 hours of symptom onset. The median follow-up time  was 3.4 (interquartile range, 1.8-5.2) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Crude and  adjusted hazard ratios of mortality obtained by Cox proportional regression  analysis. RESULTS: A system delay of 0 through 60 minutes (n = 347) corresponded  to a long-term mortality rate of 15.4\% (n = 43); a delay of 61 through 120  minutes (n = 2643) to a rate of 23.3\% (n = 380); a delay of 121 through 180  minutes (n = 2092) to a rate of 28.1\% (n = 378); and a delay of 181 through 360  minutes (n = 1127) to a rate of 30.8\% (n = 275) (P {$<$} .001). In multivariable  analysis adjusted for other predictors of mortality, system delay was  independently associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95\%  confidence interval, 1.04-1.16] per 1-hour delay), as was its components,  prehospital system delay and door-to-balloon delay.

The Abluminus  DES+™ drug-eluting stent (DES) features a novel technology of fusion coating of  PLLA bioresorbable polymer on both the abluminal surface of the stent and exposed  parts of the balloon. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy/safety  profile of the Abluminus DES+ in an all-comers population with minimal exclusion  criteria and with a specific focus on diabetic patients. METHODS: Multicenter,  prospective, all-comers registry performed in 31 centers in India. Patients were  analyzed according to the diagnosis of DM and insulin dependency (ID or Non ID):  non-DM (1256 patients), NIDDM (498 patients), IDDM (99 patients). The primary  endpoint was a composite of device-oriented major adverse cardiac events (MACE):  cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), and  ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR)/ target vessel  revascularization (TVR) at 1 year. Stent thrombosis (ST) at any time point was  also recorded. RESULTS: The MACE rate at 1 year in the overall population was  2.3\% and it was mainly driven by a 1.57\% rate of TLR/TVR. Although patients with  IDDM showed slightly higher figures for MACE (non-DM 2.3\%, NIDDM 2.8\%, IDDM 4\%,  P=0.09), as well as for single end-points, none of them reached statistical  significance. The rate of ST was 0.56\%, 0.4\%, 1\% for non-DM, NIDDM and IDDM  group, respectively (P=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the Abluminus DES+  is consistent among patients with or without diabetes, regardless the insulin  dependency.},

OBJECTIVES: This randomized clinical trial evaluated graft patency and clinical outcome after FFR-guided CABG versus angiography-guided CABG. METHODS: A total of 100 patients referred for CABG were randomly assigned to FFR-guided or angiography-guided CABG. Based on the coronary angiogram, a heart team made a graft plan for all patients, and FFR evaluations were performed. In FFR-guided CABG, coronary lesions with FFR {$>$}0.80 were deferred, and a new graft plan was designed accordingly, whereas the surgeon was blinded to the FFR values in patients who underwent angiography-guided CABG. The primary endpoint was graft failure in the percentage of all grafts after 6~months. RESULTS: Angiographic follow-up at 6~months was available for 72 patients (39 vs. 33 in the FFR-guided and angiography-guided groups, respectively). Graft failures of all grafts were similar in both groups (16\% vs. 12\%; p~=~0.97). Rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke were also similar in the study groups, and no difference was seen in revascularization before angiographic follow-up. After 6~months, deferred lesions (n~=~24) showed a significant reduction in mean FFR from index to follow-up (0.89 {\textpm} 0.05 vs. 0.81 {\textpm} 0.11; p~=~0.002). Index FFR did not influence graft patency. CONCLUSIONS: FFR-guided CABG had similar graft failure rates and clinical outcomes as angiography-guided CABG. However, FFR was reduced significantly after 6~months in deferred lesions. (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography Randomization for Graft Optimization [FARGO]; NCT02477371).},

Stenosis assessment usually relies on visual estimates of lesion severity. This study evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and angina after FFR- versus angiography-guided CABG. METHODS: One hundred patients referred for CABG were randomized to FFR- or angiography-guided CABG. In the FFR group, lesions with FFR{$>$}0.80 were deferred, while the surgeon was blinded to the FFR values in the angiography group. Before and 6 months after CABG, HRQoL was assessed by the health state classifier EQ-5D of the EuroQoL 5-level instrument and angina status based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification system were registered. RESULTS: Six-month angiography included FFR evaluations of deferred lesions. In total, completed EQ-5D of the EuroQoL 5-level instrument questionnaires were available in 86 patients (43 in the FFR versus 43 in the angiography-guided group). HRQoL was significantly improved and angina significantly decreased from baseline to 6 months after CABG with no difference between the randomization groups. Graft failure rates and clinical outcomes were similar in both groups. Patients with graft failure or FFR{$<$}0.80 of the previous deferred lesions had significantly lower visual analogue scale scores (78.7{\textpm}14.2 versus 86.8{\textpm}14.7, P=0.004) and more angina compared with patients without graft failure or FFR{$\geq$}0.80 at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: FFR- versus angiography-guided CABG demonstrated similar improvements in HRQoL and angina 6 months after CABG. Graft failure or low FFR in deferred lesions were associated with low HRQoL and angina. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02477371.},

Whether quantitative flow ratio could improve the outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting is undetermined. This study aimed to investigate the association between the quantitative flow ratio based functional incomplete revascularization and the outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. METHODS: The quantitative flow ratio assessment was retrospectively performed in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in the PATENCY trial. The anatomic complete revascularization denoted revascularizing each territory with stenosis greater than 50\% evaluated by angiography. The functional complete revascularization was defined as grafting all vessels with a quantitative flow ratio 0.80 or less. The primary end point was the 12-month composite major adverse cardiac or cerebral vascular events. RESULTS: A total of 2024 patients with available quantitative flow ratio values were included. Functional complete revascularization was achieved in 1846 patients (91.2\%), and 1600 received anatomic complete revascularization (79.1\%). Both the functional incomplete revascularization and anatomic incomplete revascularization groups were associated with significantly increased risks of 12-month major adverse cardiac or cerebral vascular events (functional: hazard ratio, 2.91; 95\% confidence interval, 1.56 to 5.43; P~=~.001; anatomic: hazard ratio, 2.82; 95\% confidence interval, 1.54 to 5.16; P~=~.001). Additionally, for the subgroup of patients (n~=~246) receiving anatomic incomplete revascularization but judged as functional complete revascularization by quantitative flow ratio, the risk of the 12-month major adverse cardiac or cerebral vascular events was not significantly increased (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.36; 95\% confidence interval, 0.71-2.60; P~=~.35). CONCLUSIONS: Both the functional incomplete revascularization and anatomic incomplete revascularization were associated with increased risks of 12-month major adverse cardiac or cerebral vascular events after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The quantitative flow ratio can serve as a supplementary tool for the decision-making of surgical revascularization.},

Whether or not QFR could predict graft outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting procedure is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association of QFR value with graft outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. METHODS: The QFR values were retrospectively obtained from patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafting surgery from 2017 to 2019 in the Graft Patency Between No-Touch Vein Harvesting Technique and Conventional Approach in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (PATENCY) trial. QFR calculation was conducted in eligible coronary arteries, defined as those with {$\geq$}50\% stenosis and a diameter {$\geq$}1.5~mm. A threshold of QFR {$\leq$}0.80 was considered functionally significant stenosis. The primary outcome was graft occlusion at 12~months evaluated by computed tomography angiography. RESULTS: Two thousand twenty-four patients with 7432 grafts (2307 arterial grafts and 5125 vein grafts) were included. For the arterial grafts, the risk of 12-month occlusion was significantly increased in the QFR {$>$}0.80 group than in the QFR {$\leq$}0.80 group (7.1\% vs 2.6\%; P~=~.001; unadjusted model: odds ratio, 3.08; 95\% CI, 1.65-5.75; fully adjusted model: odds ratio, 2.67; 95\% CI, 1.44-4.97). No significant association was observed in the vein grafts (4.6\% vs 4.3\%; P~=~.67; unadjusted model: odds ratio, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.82-1.47; fully adjusted model: odds ratio, 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.51). Results were stable across sensitivity analyses with a QFR threshold of 0.78 and 0.75. CONCLUSIONS: Target vessel QFR {$>$}0.80 was associated with a significantly higher risk of arterial graft occlusion at 12~months after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. No significant association was found between target lesion QFR and vein graft occlusion.},

However, whether FFR assessment should be routinely used before coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) remains unclear. A meta-analysis of prospectively randomized controlled trials (PRCTs) was carried out to compare the outcomes of FFR-guided CABG vs coronary angiography (CAG)-guided CABG. METHOD: The meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two PRCTs (the FARGO and GRAFFITI trials) were found and included reporting data on 269 patients with 6 and 12 month follow-up. Primary endpoints were rates of overall death, MACCE, target vessel revascularization, and spontaneous myocardial infarction (MI). Secondary endpoints were overall graft patency and patency of arterial and venous grafts. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the FFR-guided and CAG-guided groups in the rates of overall death, MACCE, target vessel revascularization, spontaneous MI and graft patency. Meta-analysis of FARGO and GRAFFITI PRCTs showed that FFR-guided CABG and CAG-guided CABG produced similar clinical outcomes with similar graft patency rates up to a year postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Currently available PRCTs showes no sufficient evidence to support the use FFR in CABG.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: GRAFFITI is a single-blinded, prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of FFR-guided versus angiography-guided CABG. We enrolled patients undergoing coronary angiography, having a significantly diseased left anterior descending artery or left main stem and at least one more major coronary artery with intermediate stenosis, assessed by FFR. Surgical strategy was defined based on angiography, blinded to FFR values prior to randomisation. After randomisation, patients were operated on either following the angiography-based strategy (angiography-guided group) or according to FFR, i.e., with an FFR {$\leq$}0.80 as cut-off for grafting (FFR-guided group). The primary endpoint was graft patency at 12 months. Between March 2012 and December 2016, 172 patients were randomised either to the angiography-guided group (84 patients) or to the FFR-guided group (88 patients). The patients had a median of three [3; 4] lesions; diameter stenosis was 65\% (50\%; 80\%), FFR was 0.72 (0.50; 0.82). Compared to the angiography-guided group, the FFR-guided group received fewer anastomoses (3 [3; 3] vs 2 [2; 3], respectively; p=0.004). One-year angiographic follow-up showed no difference in overall graft patency (126 [80\%] vs 113 [81\%], respectively; p=0.885). One-year clinical follow-up, available in 98\% of patients, showed no difference in the composite of death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: FFR guidance of CABG has no impact on one-year graft patency, but it is associated with a simplified surgical procedure. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01810224.},

The usual pharmacokinetic parameters (half-life, clearance, volume of distribution) of opioids have been known for some time. However, the metabolism has, until recently, been poorly understood, and there has been recent interest in the role of metabolites in modifying the pharmacodynamic response in patients, in both analgesia and adverse effects. A number of opioids are available for clinical use, including morphine, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Advantages and disadvantages of various opioids in the management of chronic pain are discussed. OBJECTIVE: This review looks at the structure, chemistry, and metabolism of opioids in an effort to better understand the side effects, drug interactions, and the individual responses of patients receiving opioids for the treatment of intractable pain. CONCLUSION: Mu receptor agonists and agonist-antagonists have been used throughout recent medical history for the control of pain and for the treatment of opiate induced side effects and even opiate withdrawal syndromes.},

Adjunctive use of contemporary intravascular imaging (IVI) technologies has emerged as a complement to conventional angiography---to further characterize plaque morphology and optimize the performance of PCI. IVI has utility for preintervention lesion and vessel assessment, periprocedural guidance of lesion preparation and stent deployment, and postintervention assessment of optimal endpoints and exclusion of complications. The role of IVI in reducing major adverse cardiac events in complex lesion subsets is emerging, and further studies evaluating broader use are underway or in development. This paper provides an overview of currently available IVI technologies, reviews data supporting their utilization for PCI guidance and optimization across a variety of lesion subsets, proposes best practices, and advocates for broader use of these technologies as a part of contemporary practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an acute coronary event of uncertain origin. Clinical features and prognosis remain insufficiently characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective single-center cohort study identified 87 patients with angiographically confirmed SCAD. Incidence, clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, in-hospital outcomes, and long-term risk of SCAD recurrence or major adverse cardiac events were evaluated. Mean age was 42.6 years; 82\% were female. Extreme exertion at SCAD onset was more frequent in men (7 of 16 versus 2 of 71; P{$<$}0.001), and postpartum status was observed in 13 of 71 women (18\%). Presentation was ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 49\%. Multivessel SCAD was found in 23\%. Initial conservative management (31 of 87) and coronary artery bypass grafting (7 of 87) were associated with an uncomplicated in-hospital course, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention was complicated by technical failure in 15 of 43 patients (35\%) and 1 death. During a median follow-up of 47 months (interquartile range, 18-106 months), SCAD recurred in 15 patients, all female. Estimated 10-year rate of major adverse cardiac events (death, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and SCAD recurrence) was 47\%. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the iliac artery was identified incidentally in 8 of 16 femoral angiograms (50\%) undertaken before closure device placement and in the carotid arteries of 2 others with carotid dissection. CONCLUSIONS: SCAD affects a young, predominantly female population, frequently presenting as ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Although in-hospital mortality is low regardless of initial treatment, percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with high rates of complication. Risks of SCAD recurrence and major adverse cardiac events in the long term emphasize the need for close follow-up. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a novel association and potentially causative factor.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The Academic Research Consortium for High Bleeding Risk (ARC-HBR) defined consensus-based criteria for patients at high bleeding risk (HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We aimed to validate the ARC-HBR criteria for the bleeding outcomes using a large cohort of patients undergoing PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2016, patients undergoing PCI were prospectively included in the Bern PCI Registry. Patients were considered to be at HBR if at least one major criterion or two minor criteria were met. The primary endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5 bleeding at one year; ischaemic outcomes were assessed using the device-oriented composite endpoints (DOCE) of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularisation. Among 12,121 patients, those at HBR (n=4,781, 39.4\%) had an increased risk of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding (6.4\% vs 1.9\%; p{$<$}0.001) and DOCE (12.5\% vs 6.1\%; p{$<$}0.001) compared with those without HBR. The degree of risk and prognostic value were related to the risk factors composing the criteria. The ARC-HBR criteria had higher sensitivity than the PRECISE-DAPT score and the PARIS bleeding risk score (63.8\%, 53.1\%, 31.9\%), but lower specificity (62.7\%, 71.3\%, 86.5\%) for BARC 3 or 5 bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Patients at HBR defined by the ARC-HBR criteria had a higher risk of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding as well as DOCE. The bleeding risk was related to its individual components. The ARC-HBR criteria were more sensitive for identifying patients with future bleedings than other contemporary risk scores at the cost of specificity. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02241291},

We aimed to identify the incidence of target lesion  revascularization (TLR) and explore clinical, procedural, and other factors  influencing it. METHODS: Single-center retrospective analysis of a prospective  cohort PCI registry study included 80 patients (100 lesions) who underwent  successful DCB angioplasty between January 2020 and October 2023 and follow-up  angiography within 2 years of either planned or unplanned reason. Incidence and  factors associated with TLR were analyzed. RESULTS: Angiographic evaluation was  conducted within a median of 151 days (interquartile range: 109 days). During  index procedure, 54\% were complex lesions. Intravascular imaging (IVI) was  performed in 80\% of lesions. TLR occurred in 11\% of the lesions and was less  frequent in the IVI group compared to the angiography-alone group [6.3 vs. 54.5\%;  odds ratio: 0.156, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.042-0.580; p\,=\,0.002]. No  association was found between baseline and lesion characteristics, lesion  complexity, plaque morphology, pre-dilatation procedure balloon type, maximal  inflation pressure, or length of DCB between the groups (p\,{$>$}\,0.05). Multivariate  analysis revealed that IVI utilization was independently associated with a lower  TLR rate (adjusted odds ratio: 0.116, 95\% CI: 0.020-0.669; p\,=\,0.016).  CONCLUSION: In DCB angioplasty, only IVI use exhibited a significant difference  in the TLR rate among baseline lesion characteristics and lesion preparation and  was independently associated with a lower TLR rate.},

The aim of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of the biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent with the durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent in patients at high bleeding risk receiving 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI. METHODS: The Bioflow-DAPT Study is an international, randomized, open-label trial conducted at 52 interventional cardiology hospitals in 18 countries from February 24, 2020, through September 20, 2021. Patients with a clinical indication to PCI because of acute or chronic coronary syndrome who fulfilled 1 or more criteria for high bleeding risk were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomized to receive either biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stents or durable-polymer, slow-release zotarolimus-eluting stents after successful lesion preparation, followed by 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy and thereafter single antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis at 1 year, and was powered for noninferiority, with an absolute margin of 4.1\% at 1-sided 5\% alpha. RESULTS: A total of 1948 patients at high bleeding risk were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stents (969 patients) or durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stents (979 patients). At 1 year, the primary outcome was observed in 33 of 969 patients (3.6\%) in the biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent group and in 32 of 979 patients (3.4\%) in the durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent group (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points; upper boundary of the 1-sided 95\% CI, 1.8; upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5\% CI, 2.1; P{$<$}0.0001 for noninferiority for both tests). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high risk for bleeding who received 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, the use of biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stents was noninferior to the use of durable-polymer zotarolimus-eluting stents with regard to the composite of death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months is the standard of care after coronary stenting in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this individual patient-level meta-analysis was to summarise the evidence comparing DAPT de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy versus continuing DAPT for 12 months after coronary drug-eluting stent implantation. METHODS: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised trials with centrally adjudicated endpoints was performed to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of ticagrelor monotherapy (90 mg twice a day) after short-term DAPT (from 2 weeks to 3 months) versus 12-month DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with a coronary drug-eluting stent. Randomised trials comparing P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy with DAPT after coronary revascularisation were searched in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and two websites (www.tctmd.com and www.escardio.org) from database inception up to May 20, 2024. Trials that included patients with an indication for long-term oral anticoagulants were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The principal investigators of the eligible trials provided IPD by means of an anonymised electronic dataset. The three ranked coprimary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE; a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) tested for non-inferiority in the per-protocol population; and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5 bleeding and all-cause death tested for superiority in the intention-to-treat population. All outcomes are reported as Kaplan-Meier estimates. The non-inferiority was tested using a one-sided {$\alpha$} of 0{$\cdot$}025 with the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1{$\cdot$}15 (hazard ratio [HR] scale), followed by the ranked superiority testing at a two-sided {$\alpha$} of 0{$\cdot$}05. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024506083). FINDINGS: A total of 8361 unique citations were screened, of which 610 records were considered potentially eligible during the screening of titles and abstracts. Of these, six trials that randomly assigned patients to ticagrelor monotherapy or DAPT were identified. De-escalation took place a median of 78 days (IQR 31-92) after intervention, with a median duration of treatment of 334 days (329-365). Among 23\,256 patients in the per-protocol population, MACCE occurred in 297 (Kaplan-Meier estimate 2{$\cdot$}8\%) with ticagrelor monotherapy and 332 (Kaplan-Meier estimate 3{$\cdot$}2\%) with DAPT (HR 0{$\cdot$}91 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}78-1{$\cdot$}07]; p=0{$\cdot$}0039 for non-inferiority; {$\tau$}(2){$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Among 24\,407 patients in the intention-to-treat population, the risks of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding (Kaplan-Meier estimate 0{$\cdot$}9\% vs 2{$\cdot$}1\%; HR 0{$\cdot$}43 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}34-0{$\cdot$}54]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001 for superiority; {$\tau$}(2)=0{$\cdot$}079) and all-cause death (Kaplan-Meier estimate 0{$\cdot$}9\% vs 1{$\cdot$}2\%; 0{$\cdot$}76 [0{$\cdot$}59-0{$\cdot$}98]; p=0{$\cdot$}034 for superiority; {$\tau$}(2){$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) were lower with ticagrelor monotherapy. Trial sequential analysis showed strong evidence of non-inferiority for MACCE and superiority for bleeding among the overall and ACS populations (the z-curve crossed the monitoring boundaries or the required information size without crossing the futility boundaries or approaching the null). The treatment effects were heterogeneous by sex for MACCE (p interaction=0{$\cdot$}041) and all-cause death (p interaction=0{$\cdot$}050), indicating a possible benefit in women with ticagrelor monotherapy, and by clinical presentation for bleeding (p interaction=0{$\cdot$}022), indicating a benefit in ACS with ticagrelor monotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Our study found robust evidence that, compared with 12 months of DAPT, de-escalation to ticagrelor monotherapy does not increase ischaemic risk and reduces the risk of major bleeding, especially in patients with ACS. Ticagrelor monotherapy might also be associated with a mortality benefit, particularly among women, which warrants further investigation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The appropriate duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at high risk for bleeding after the implantation of a drug-eluting coronary stent  remains unclear. METHODS: One month after they had undergone implantation of a  biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting coronary stent, we randomly assigned  patients at high bleeding risk to discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy  immediately (abbreviated therapy) or to continue it for at least 2 additional  months (standard therapy). The three ranked primary outcomes were net adverse  clinical events (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction,  stroke, or major bleeding), major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (a composite  of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke), and major or  clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding; cumulative incidences were assessed at 335  days. The first two outcomes were assessed for noninferiority in the per-protocol  population, and the third outcome for superiority in the intention-to-treat  population. RESULTS: Among the 4434 patients in the per-protocol population, net  adverse clinical events occurred in 165 patients (7.5\%) in the  abbreviated-therapy group and in 172 (7.7\%) in the standard-therapy group  (difference, -0.23 percentage points; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -1.80 to  1.33; P{$<$}0.001 for noninferiority). A total of 133 patients (6.1\%) in the  abbreviated-therapy group and 132 patients (5.9\%) in the standard-therapy group  had a major adverse cardiac or cerebral event (difference, 0.11 percentage  points; 95\% CI, -1.29 to 1.51; P\,=\,0.001 for noninferiority). Among the 4579  patients in the intention-to-treat population, major or clinically relevant  nonmajor bleeding occurred in 148 patients (6.5\%) in the abbreviated-therapy  group and in 211 (9.4\%) in the standard-therapy group (difference, -2.82  percentage points; 95\% CI, -4.40 to -1.24; P{$<$}0.001 for superiority). CONCLUSIONS:  One month of dual antiplatelet therapy was noninferior to the continuation of  therapy for at least 2 additional months with regard to the occurrence of net  adverse clinical events and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events; abbreviated  therapy also resulted in a lower incidence of major or clinically relevant  nonmajor bleeding.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the risks and benefits of P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy compared with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and whether these associations are modified by patients' characteristics. DESIGN: Individual patient level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Ovid Medline, Embase, and three websites (www.tctmd.com, www.escardio.org, www.acc.org/cardiosourceplus) from inception to 16 July 2020. The primary authors provided individual participant data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing effects of oral P2Y(12) monotherapy and DAPT on centrally adjudicated endpoints after coronary revascularisation in patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, tested for non-inferiority against a margin of 1.15 for the hazard ratio. The key safety endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or type 5 bleeding. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included data from six trials, including 24\,096 patients. The primary outcome occurred in 283 (2.95\%) patients with P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy and 315 (3.27\%) with DAPT in the per protocol population (hazard ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.09; P=0.005 for non-inferiority; P=0.38 for superiority; {$\tau$}(2)=0.00) and in 303 (2.94\%) with P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy and 338 (3.36\%) with DAPT in the intention to treat population (0.90, 0.77 to 1.05; P=0.18 for superiority; {$\tau$}(2)=0.00). The treatment effect was consistent across all subgroups, except for sex (P for interaction=0.02), suggesting that P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy lowers the risk of the primary ischaemic endpoint in women (hazard ratio 0.64, 0.46 to 0.89) but not in men (1.00, 0.83 to 1.19). The risk of bleeding was lower with P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy than with DAPT (97 (0.89\%) v 197 (1.83\%); hazard ratio 0.49, 0.39 to 0.63; P{$<$}0.001; {$\tau$}(2)=0.03), which was consistent across subgroups, except for type of P2Y(12) inhibitor (P for interaction=0.02), suggesting greater benefit when a newer P2Y(12) inhibitor rather than clopidogrel was part of the DAPT regimen. CONCLUSIONS: P2Y(12) inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a similar risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, with evidence that this association may be modified by sex, and a lower bleeding risk compared with DAPT.

MO was associated  with the occurrence of MACE, defined as a composite of cardiac death, congestive  heart failure, and myocardial re-infarction (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.74; 95\%  confidence interval: 2.21 to 6.34). IS\%LV {$\geq$}25\% was not associated with MACE  (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.90; 95\% confidence interval: 0.59 to 1.37).

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their effectiveness on a diverse range of clinical summarization tasks remains unproven. Here we applied adaptation methods to eight LLMs, spanning four distinct clinical summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions, progress notes and doctor--patient dialogue. Quantitative assessments with syntactic, semantic and conceptual NLP metrics reveal trade-offs between models and adaptation methods. A clinical reader study with 10 physicians evaluated summary completeness, correctness and conciseness; in most cases, summaries from our best-adapted LLMs were deemed either equivalent (45\%) or superior (36\%) compared with summaries from medical experts. The ensuing safety analysis highlights challenges faced by both LLMs and medical experts, as we connect errors to potential medical harm and categorize types of fabricated information. Our research provides evidence of LLMs outperforming medical experts in clinical text summarization across multiple tasks. This suggests that integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate documentation burden, allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care.}

METHOD: The descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in 7  primary care clinics in 3 Canadian provinces, Ontario, British Columbia, and Nova  Scotia, from December 6, 2005, to May 5, 2006. Patients in clinic waiting rooms  who consented to participate in the study were administered the Mini  International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (N = 840). These patients'  medical charts were then reviewed for evidence of previous diagnosis of a mood or  anxiety disorder. Misdiagnosis was defined as cases for which a diagnosis was  reached on the MINI but not in the patient's chart. RESULTS: Of the 840 primary  care patients assessed, 27.2\%, 11.4\%, 12.6\%, 31.2\%, and 16.5\% of patients met  criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, panic disorder,  generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder, respectively.  Misdiagnosis rates reached 65.9\% for major depressive disorder, 92.7\% for bipolar  disorder, 85.8\% for panic disorder, 71.0\% for generalized anxiety disorder, and  97.8\% for social anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: With high prevalence rates and  poor detection, there is an obvious need to enhance diagnostic screening in the  primary care setting.},

  abstract = {Balloon expandable coronary stenting has revolutionized the field of interventional cardiology as a potential, minimally invasive modality for  treating coronary artery disease. Even though stenting is successful compared to  angioplasty (that leaves no stent in place), still there are many associated  clinical complications. Bare metal stents are associated with in-stent restenosis  caused mostly by neointimal hyperplasia, whereas success of drug-eluting stents  comes at the expense of late-stent thrombosis and neoatherosclerosis. Even though  innovative and promising, clinical trials with bioabsorbable stents reported  thrombosis and a rapid pace of degradation without performing scaffolding action  in several instances. It should be noted that a vast majority of these stents are  based on a metallic platform which still holds the potential to mitigate major  cardiovascular events and reduced economic burden to patients, alongside  continuous improvement in stent technology and antiplatelet regimes. Hence, a  systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to assess the  clinically relevant material properties for a metallic stent material. From a  materials perspective, the major causes identified for clinical failure of stents  are inferior mechanical properties and blood-material interaction-related  complications at the stent surface. In addition to these, the stent material  should possess increased radiopacity for improved visibility and lower magnetic  susceptibility values for artefact reduction. Moreover, the review provides an  overview of future scope of percutaneous coronary interventional strategy. Most  importantly, this review highlights the need for an interdisciplinary approach by  clinicians, biomaterial scientists, and interventional cardiologists to  collaborate in mitigating the impediments associated with cardiovascular stents  for alleviating sufferings of millions of people worldwide.},

BACKGROUND: Recent 1- and 3-year results from randomized trials  have indicated similar safety and efficacy outcomes of BP-BES and DP-EES. Whether  benefits of the biodegradable polymer device arise over longer follow-up is  unknown. Moreover, in-depth, prospective, long-term follow-up data on metallic  drug-eluting stents with durable or biodegradable polymers are scarce. METHODS:  The COMPARE II trial (Abluminal Biodegradable Polymer Biolimus-Eluting Stent  Versus Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent) was a prospective, randomized,  multicenter, all-comers trial in which 2,707 patients were randomly allocated  (2:1) to BP-BES or DP-EES. The pre-specified endpoint at 5 years was major  adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial  infarction, or target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: Five-year follow-up was  available in 2,657 patients (98\%). At 5 years, major adverse cardiac events  occurred in 310 patients (17.3\%) in the BP-BES group and 142 patients (15.6\%) in  the DP-EES group (p~= 0.26). The rate of the~combined safety endpoint all-cause  death or myocardial infarction was 15.0\% in the BP-BES group versus 14.8\% in~the  DP-EES group (p~= 0.90), whereas the efficacy measure target vessel  revascularization was 10.6\% versus 9.0\% (p~= 0.18), respectively. Interestingly,  definite stent thrombosis rates did not differ between groups (1.5\% for BP-BES  vs. 0.9\% for DP-EES; p~= 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year analysis comparing  biodegradable polymer-coated BES and the durable polymer-coated EES confirms the  initial early- and mid-term results regarding similar safety and efficacy  outcomes in this all-comers percutaneous coronary intervention population.},

Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL ({$<$}3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4-2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20\% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater ({$>$}3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater ({$>$}/=2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. OBSERVATIONS: Approximately 90\% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1\% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level ({$<$}20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible, direct-acting inhibitor of the adenosine diphosphate receptor P2Y12 that has a more rapid onset and more pronounced platelet inhibition than clopidogrel. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, we compared ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) and clopidogrel (300-to-600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter) for the prevention of cardiovascular events in 18,624 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation. RESULTS: At 12 months, the primary end point--a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke--had occurred in 9.8\% of patients receiving ticagrelor as compared with 11.7\% of those receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.92; P{$<$}0.001). Predefined hierarchical testing of secondary end points showed significant differences in the rates of other composite end points, as well as myocardial infarction alone (5.8\% in the ticagrelor group vs. 6.9\% in the clopidogrel group, P=0.005) and death from vascular causes (4.0\% vs. 5.1\%, P=0.001) but not stroke alone (1.5\% vs. 1.3\%, P=0.22). The rate of death from any cause was also reduced with ticagrelor (4.5\%, vs. 5.9\% with clopidogrel; P{$<$}0.001). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding was found between the ticagrelor and clopidogrel groups (11.6\% and 11.2\%, respectively; P=0.43), but ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (4.5\% vs. 3.8\%, P=0.03), including more instances of fatal intracranial bleeding and fewer of fatal bleeding of other types. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have an acute coronary syndrome with or without ST-segment elevation, treatment with ticagrelor as compared with clopidogrel significantly reduced the rate of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke without an increase in the rate of overall major bleeding but with an increase in the rate of non-procedure-related bleeding.

Our study aimed to  systematically review the literature and investigate the participation rates and  influencing factors of CR in patients with AMI. METHODS: We searched 10  databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and so forth. A  systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on the studies on the factors  affecting CR participation in AMI. The Q tests and the I(2) tests were used to  assess heterogeneity between studies. The combined effect size and odds ratio  (OR) and their respective 95\% confidence interval (CI) for CR participation rate  and its influences are expressed, respectively. Stata 17.0 software was used for  statistical analysis. RESULTS: We included 14 studies with 114\,542 participants.  Current evidence indicates a CR participation rate of 34\% (95\% CI: 21\%-46\%) in  patients with AMI. The pooled OR values and CI of each influencing factor are as  follows: over 60 years old (OR\,=\,0.865; 95\% CI: 0.772-0.969), male (OR\,=\,1.690;  95\% CI: 1.276-2.239), college education or above (OR\,=\,2.526; 95\% CI:  1.117-5.711), ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR\,=\,4.257; 95\% CI:  2.004-9.045), decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (OR\,=\,0.918; 95\% CI:  0.868-0.971), higher economic level (OR\,=\,1.282; 95\% CI: 1.108-1.483), history of  coronary heart disease(OR\,=\,0.667; 95\% CI: 0.509-0.875), smoking (OR\,=\,0.665; 95\%  CI: 0.550-0.805), combined hypertension (OR\,=\,0.638; 95\% CI: 0.562-0.723), and  combined hyperlipidemia (OR\,=\,0.577; 95\% CI: 0.512-0.651). CONCLUSIONS: The  overall participation rate of CR in AMI patients is low, and various factors  affect the participation rate. Specialist medical staff are needed to further  promote CR rehabilitation concepts and scientific knowledge, and take appropriate  measures to address the influencing factors to increase CR utilization and  improve patient prognosis.},

  abstract = {Background In coronary artery bypass grafting, grafting a target vessel with nonsignificant stenosis increases the risk of graft failure. The present study aims to investigate the impact of preoperative quantitative flow ratio (QFR), a novel functional assessment of the coronary artery, on internal mammary artery graft failure rate and midterm patient outcomes. Methods and Results Between January 2016 and January 2020, we retrospectively included 419 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting who had received preoperative angiography and postoperative coronary computed tomographic angiography in our center. QFR of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was computed based on preoperative angiograms. The primary end point was the failure of the graft on the LAD artery assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography at 1\,year, and the secondary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events including death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization. Grafts on functionally nonsignificant LAD arteries (QFR {$>$}0.80) had a significantly higher failure rate than those on functionally significant LAD arteries (31.4\% versus 7.2\%, P{$<$}0.001). QFR outperforms degree of stenosis in discriminating graft failure (C statistic, 0.76 versus 0.58). Clinical follow-up (3.6\,years, interquartile range [3.3-4.1]) was accomplished in 405 patients, and the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was significantly higher among patients with functionally nonsignificant LAD arteries (10.1\% versus 4.2\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 3.08 [95\% CI, 1.18-8.06]; P=0.022). Conclusions In patients receiving internal mammary artery to LAD artery coronary artery bypass grafting, preoperative QFR of the LAD artery of {$>$}0.80 was associated with a higher graft failure rate at 1\,year and worse patient outcomes at the 3.6-year follow-up.},

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis of noninferiority of 1 to 2 months of DAPT compared with 12 months of DAPT for a composite end point of cardiovascular and bleeding events in patients with ACS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 4169 patients with ACS who underwent successful PCI using cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents at 96 centers in Japan from December 2015 through June 2020. These data were analyzed from June to July 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized either to 1 to 2 months of DAPT followed by clopidogrel monotherapy (n\,=\,2078) or to 12 months of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel (n\,=\,2091). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction [MI], any stroke, or definite stent thrombosis) or bleeding (Thrombolysis in MI major or minor bleeding) events at 12 months, with a noninferiority margin of 50\% on the hazard ratio (HR) scale. The major secondary end points were cardiovascular and bleeding components of the primary end point. RESULTS: Among 4169 randomized patients, 33 withdrew consent. Of the 4136 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 66.8 (11.9) years, and 856 (21\%) were women, 2324 (56\%) had ST-segment elevation MI, and 826 (20\%) had non-ST-segment elevation MI. A total of 4107 patients (99.3\%) completed the 1-year follow-up in June 2021. One to 2 months of DAPT was not noninferior to 12 months of DAPT for the primary end point, which occurred in 65 of 2058 patients (3.2\%) in the 1- to 2-month DAPT group and in 58 of 2057 patients (2.8\%) in the 12-month DAPT group (absolute difference, 0.37\% [95\% CI, -0.68\% to 1.42\%]; HR, 1.14 [95\% CI, 0.80-1.62]; P for noninferiority\,=\,.06). The major secondary cardiovascular end point occurred in 56 patients (2.8\%) in the 1- to 2-month DAPT group and in 38 patients (1.9\%) in the 12-month DAPT group (absolute difference, 0.90\% [95\% CI, -0.02\% to 1.82\%]; HR, 1.50 [95\% CI, 0.99-2.26]). The major secondary bleeding end point occurred in 11 patients (0.5\%) in the 1- to 2-month DAPT group and 24 patients (1.2\%) in the 12-month DAPT group (absolute difference, -0.63\% [95\% CI, -1.20\% to -0.06\%]; HR, 0.46 [95\% CI, 0.23-0.94]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with ACS with successful PCI, clopidogrel monotherapy after 1 to 2 months of DAPT failed to attest noninferiority to standard 12 months of DAPT for the net clinical benefit with a numerical increase in cardiovascular events despite reduction in bleeding events. The directionally different efficacy and safety outcomes indicate the need for further clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02619760 and NCT03462498.},

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis of noninferiority of 1 month  of DAPT compared with standard 12 months of DAPT for a composite end point of  cardiovascular and bleeding events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 3045 patients who  underwent PCI at 90 hospitals in Japan from December 2015 through December 2017.  Final 1-year clinical follow-up was completed in January 2019. INTERVENTIONS:  Patients were randomized either to 1 month of DAPT followed by clopidogrel  monotherapy (n=1523) or to 12 months of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel  (n=1522). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was a composite of  cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke,  definite stent thrombosis, or major or minor bleeding at 12 months, with a  relative noninferiority margin of 50\%. The major secondary cardiovascular end  point was a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, ischemic or hemorrhagic  stroke, or definite stent thrombosis and the major secondary bleeding end point  was major or minor bleeding. RESULTS: Among 3045 patients randomized, 36 withdrew  consent; of 3009 remaining, 2974 (99\%) completed the trial. One-month DAPT was  both noninferior and superior to 12-month DAPT for the primary end point,  occurring in 2.36\% with 1-month DAPT and 3.70\% with 12-month DAPT (absolute  difference, -1.34\% [95\% CI, -2.57\% to -0.11\%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.64 [95\% CI,  0.42-0.98]), meeting criteria for noninferiority (P\,{$<$}\,.001) and for superiority  (P\,=\,.04).

The major secondary  bleeding end point occurred in 0.41\% with 1-month DAPT and 1.54\% with 12-month  DAPT (absolute difference, -1.13\% [95\% CI, -1.84\% to -0.42\%]; HR, 0.26 [95\% CI,  0.11-0.64]; P\,=\,.004 for superiority). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients  undergoing PCI, 1 month of DAPT followed by clopidogrel monotherapy, compared  with 12 months of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, resulted in a significantly  lower rate of a composite of cardiovascular and bleeding events, meeting criteria  for both noninferiority and superiority. These findings suggest that a shorter  duration of DAPT may provide benefit, although given study limitations,  additional research is needed in other populations.

  abstract = {Our knowledge about how low-dose (analgesic) morphine affects autonomic cardiovascular regulation is primarily limited to animal experiments. Notably, it is unknown if low-dose morphine affects human autonomic cardiovascular responses during painful stimuli in conscious humans. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that low-dose morphine reduces perceived pain and subsequent sympathetic and cardiovascular responses in humans during an experimental noxious stimulus. Twenty-nine participants (14 females/15 males; 29\,{\textpm}\,6 yr; 26\,{\textpm}\,4 kg{$\cdot$}m(-2), means {\textpm} SD) completed this randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial during two laboratory visits. During each visit, participants completed a cold pressor test (CPT; hand in {$\sim$}0.4{$^\circ$}C ice bath for 2 min) before and {$\sim$}35 min after drug/placebo administration (5 mg iv morphine or saline). We compared pain perception (100 mm visual analog scale), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography; 14 paired recordings), and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP; photoplethysmography) between trials (at both pre- and postdrug/placebo time points) using paired, two-tailed t tests. Before drug/placebo infusion, perceived pain (P = 0.92), {$\Delta$}MSNA burst frequency (n = 14, P = 0.21), and {$\Delta$}mean BP (P = 0.39) during the CPT were not different between trials. After the drug/placebo infusion, morphine versus placebo attenuated perceived pain (morphine: 43\,{\textpm}\,20 vs. placebo: 57\,{\textpm}\,24 mm, P {$<$} 0.001) and {$\Delta$}mean BP (morphine: 10\,{\textpm}\,7 vs. placebo: 13\,{\textpm}\,8 mmHg, P = 0.003), but not {$\Delta$}MSNA burst frequency (morphine: 10\,{\textpm}\,11 vs. placebo: 13\,{\textpm}\,11 bursts{$\cdot$}min(-1), P = 0.12), during the CPT. Reductions in pain perception and {$\Delta$}mean BP were only weakly related (r = 0.34, P = 0.07; postmorphine CPT minus postplacebo CPT). These data provide valuable information regarding how low-dose morphine affects autonomic cardiovascular responses during an experimental painful stimulus.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY In this randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial, we found that low-dose morphine administration reduced pain perception and blood pressure responses during the cold pressor test via attenuated increases in heart rate and cardiac output. We also determined that muscle sympathetic outflow responses during the cold pressor test seem to be unaffected by low-dose morphine administration. Finally, our exploratory analysis suggests that biological sex does not influence morphine-induced antinociception in healthy adults.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Due to the limitations of 12-lead ECG, occlusions of the left circumflex artery (LCX) are more likely to present as non-ST-elevation acute coronary  syndrome (NSTEACS) compared with other coronary arteries. We aimed to study  mortality in patients with LCX lesions and to assess the importance of coronary  artery dominance on triage of these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the  Eastern Danish Heart Registry, 3,632 NSTEACS and 3,907 ST-elevation myocardial  infarction (STEMI) consecutive, single-vessel disease patients were included. LCX  was the culprit in 25\% of NSTEACS and 14\% of STEMIs (p{$<$}0.001). LCX lesions  presented predominantly as STEMI in left dominant coronary arteries compared with  NSTEACS (46\% vs. 30\%, p{$<$}0.001). Higher 30-day mortality was found in LCX-STEMI  compared with LCX-NSTEACS (HR 7.9, 95\% CI: 3.2-19.7, p{$<$}0.001) with no difference  in long-term mortality (HR 0.9, 95\% CI: 0.7-1.2, p=0.5). LCX-NSTEACS were not  associated with higher mortality compared with other NSTEACS lesions.  CONCLUSIONS: The 12-lead ECG seems sufficient for triage of patients with LCX  lesions as a majority of patients with a large LCX due to a dominant left  coronary artery present as STEMI. Patients with LCX-NSTEACS do not have higher  mortality compared with patients with LCX-STEMI or NSTEACS with lesions in other  coronary territories.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel stent platform eluting biolimus, a sirolimus analogue, from a biodegradable polymer showed promising results in preliminary studies. We  compared the safety and efficacy of a biolimus-eluting stent (with biodegradable  polymer) with a sirolimus-eluting stent (with durable polymer). METHODS: We  undertook a multicentre, assessor-blind, non-inferiority study in ten European  centres. 1707 patients aged 18 years or older with chronic stable coronary artery  disease or acute coronary syndromes were centrally randomised by a  computer-generated allocation sequence to treatment with either biolimus-eluting  (n=857) or sirolimus-eluting (n=850) stents. The primary endpoint was a composite  of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or clinically-indicated target vessel  revascularisation within 9 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. 427  patients were randomly allocated to angiographic follow-up, with in-stent  percentage diameter stenosis as principal outcome measure at 9 months. The trial  is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00389220. FINDINGS: We analysed  all randomised patients. Biolimus-eluting stents were non-inferior to  sirolimus-eluting stents for the primary endpoint at 9 months (79 [9\%] patients  vs 89 [11\%], rate ratio 0.88 [95\% CI 0.64-1.19], p for non-inferiority=0.003, p  for superiority=0.39). Frequency of cardiac death (14 [1.6\%] vs 21 [2.5\%], p for  superiority=0.22), myocardial infarction (49 [5.7\%] vs 39 [4.6\%], p=0.30), and  clinically-indicated target vessel revascularisation (38 [4.4\%] vs 47 [5.5\%],  p=0.29) were similar for both stent types. 168 (79\%) patients in the  biolimus-eluting group and 167 (78\%) in the sirolimus-eluting group had data for  angiographic follow-up available. Biolimus-eluting stents were non-inferior to  sirolimus-eluting stents in in-stent percentage diameter stenosis (20.9\%vs 23.3\%,  difference -2.2\% [95\% CI -6.0 to 1.6], p for non-inferiority=0.001, p for  superiority=0.26). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that a stent eluting  biolimus from a biodegradable polymer represents a safe and effective alternative  to a stent eluting sirolimus from a durable polymer in patients with chronic  stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes.

OBJECTIVES: This study reports the final 2-year results of the  randomized Onyx ONE trial. METHODS: The Onyx ONE (A Randomized Controlled Trial  With Resolute Onyx in One Month Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) for  High-Bleeding Risk Patients) trial randomly assigned HBR patients to treatment  with ZES or DCS. Following 1-month DAPT, event-free patients received SAPT  (either aspirin or a P2Y(12) inhibitor at physician discretion). The primary  safety endpoint, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent  thrombosis at 1 year, was determined at 1 year. Rates of primary and secondary  endpoints were calculated after final follow-up at 2 years. RESULTS: A total of  1,003 patients were randomly allocated to ZES and 993 patients to DCS. Follow-up  was complete in 980 (97.7\%) ZES patients and 962 (96.9\%) DCS patients at 2 years.  The primary safety endpoint occurred in 208 (21.2\%) patients in the ZES group and  199 (20.7\%) patients in the DCS group (risk difference: 0.5\%; 95\%~CI: -3.1\% to  4.2\%; P~=~0.78) at 2 years without significant differences in individual  components of the composite endpoint. The secondary effectiveness endpoint  occurred in 217 (22.1\%) patients in the ZES group and 202 (21.0\%) patients in the  DCS group (risk difference: 1.1\%; 95\%~CI: -2.5\% to 4.8\%; P~=~0.54). CONCLUSIONS:  Among patients at HBR treated with 1-month DAPT followed by SAPT, the Resolute  Onyx polymer-based ZES had similar 2-year outcomes for the primary safety and  secondary effectiveness endpoint compared with the BioFreedom polymer-free DCS.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine is a cornerstone of treatment to prevent thrombotic complications of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS: To compare prasugrel, a new thienopyridine, with clopidogrel, we randomly assigned 13,608 patients with moderate-to-high-risk acute coronary syndromes with scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention to receive prasugrel (a 60-mg loading dose and a 10-mg daily maintenance dose) or clopidogrel (a 300-mg loading dose and a 75-mg daily maintenance dose), for 6 to 15 months. The primary efficacy end point was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The key safety end point was major bleeding. RESULTS: The primary efficacy end point occurred in 12.1\% of patients receiving clopidogrel and 9.9\% of patients receiving prasugrel (hazard ratio for prasugrel vs. clopidogrel, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.90; P{$<$}0.001). We also found significant reductions in the prasugrel group in the rates of myocardial infarction (9.7\% for clopidogrel vs. 7.4\% for prasugrel; P{$<$}0.001), urgent target-vessel revascularization (3.7\% vs. 2.5\%; P{$<$}0.001), and stent thrombosis (2.4\% vs. 1.1\%; P{$<$}0.001). Major bleeding was observed in 2.4\% of patients receiving prasugrel and in 1.8\% of patients receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.68; P=0.03). Also greater in the prasugrel group was the rate of life-threatening bleeding (1.4\% vs. 0.9\%; P=0.01), including nonfatal bleeding (1.1\% vs. 0.9\%; hazard ratio, 1.25; P=0.23) and fatal bleeding (0.4\% vs. 0.1\%; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute coronary syndromes with scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention, prasugrel therapy was associated with significantly reduced rates of ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, but with an increased risk of major bleeding, including fatal bleeding. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00097591 [ClinicalTrials.gov].)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative flow ratio derived from computed tomography angiography (CT-QFR) and invasive coronary angiography (Murray law-based quantitative flow  ratio [{$\mu$}QFR]) are novel approaches enabling rapid computation of fractional flow  reserve without the use of pressure guidewires and vasodilators. However, the  feasibility and diagnostic performance of both CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR in evaluating  complex coronary lesions remain unclear. METHODS: Between September 2014 and  September 2021, 240 patients with 30\% to 90\% coronary diameter stenosis who  underwent both coronary computed tomography angiography and invasive coronary  angiography with fractional flow reserve within 60 days were retrospectively  enrolled. The diagnostic performance of CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR in detecting functional  ischemia among all lesions, especially complex coronary lesions, was analyzed  using fractional flow reserve as the reference standard. RESULTS: CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR  analyses were performed on 309 and 289 vessels, respectively. The diagnostic  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,  and accuracy for CT-QFR in all lesions at the per-vessel level were 91\% (with a  95\% CI of 84\%-96\%), 92\% (95\% CI, 88\%-95\%), 83\% (95\% CI, 75\%-90\%), 96\% (95\% CI,  93\%-98\%), and 92\% (95\% CI, 88\%-95\%), with values for {$\mu$}QFR of 90\% (95\% CI,  81\%-95\%), 97\% (95\% CI, 93\%-99\%), 92\% (95\% CI, 84\%-97\%), 96\% (95\% CI, 92\%-98\%),  and 94\% (95\% CI, 91\%-97\%), respectively. Among bifurcation, tandem, and  moderate-to-severe calcified lesions, the diagnostic values of CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR  showed great correlation and agreement with those of invasive fractional flow  reserve, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve  exceeding 0.9 for each complex lesion at the vessel level. Furthermore, the  accuracies of CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR in the gray zone were 85\% and 84\%, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio (CT-QFR and {$\mu$}QFR)  demonstrated remarkable diagnostic performance in complex coronary lesions,  indicating its pivotal role in the management of patients with coronary artery  disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compared with visual angiographic assessment, pressure wire-based physiological measurement more accurately identifies flow-limiting lesions in  patients with coronary artery disease. Nonetheless, angiography remains the most  widely used method to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In FAVOR  III China, we aimed to establish whether clinical outcomes might be improved by  lesion selection for PCI using the quantitative flow ratio (QFR), a novel  angiography-based approach to estimate the fractional flow reserve. METHODS:  FAVOR III China is a multicentre, blinded, randomised, sham-controlled trial done  at 26 hospitals in China. Patients aged 18 years or older, with stable or  unstable angina pectoris or patients who had a myocardial infarction at least 72  h before screening, who had at least one lesion with a diameter stenosis of  50-90\% in a coronary artery with a reference vessel of at least 2{$\cdot$}5 mm diameter  by visual assessment were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to a  QFR-guided strategy (PCI performed only if QFR {$\leq$}0{$\cdot$}80) or an angiography-guided  strategy (PCI based on standard visual angiographic assessment). Participants and  clinical assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was  the 1-year rate of major adverse cardiac events, a composite of death from any  cause, myocardial infarction, or ischaemia-driven revascularisation. The primary  analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03656848). FINDINGS: Between Dec 25, 2018, and Jan  19, 2020, 3847 patients were enrolled. After exclusion of 22 patients who elected  not to undergo PCI or who were withdrawn by their physicians, 3825 participants  were included in the intention-to-treat population (1913 in the QFR-guided group  and 1912 in the angiography-guided group). The mean age was 62{$\cdot$}7 years (SD 10{$\cdot$}1),  2699 (70{$\cdot$}6\%) were men and 1126 (29{$\cdot$}4\%) were women, 1295 (33{$\cdot$}9\%) had diabetes, and  2428 (63{$\cdot$}5\%) presented with an acute coronary syndrome. The 1-year primary  endpoint occurred in 110 (Kaplan-Meier estimated rate 5{$\cdot$}8\%) participants in the  QFR-guided group and in 167 (8{$\cdot$}8\%) participants in the angiography-guided group  (difference, -3{$\cdot$}0\% [95\% CI -4{$\cdot$}7 to -1{$\cdot$}4]; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}65 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}51 to  0{$\cdot$}83]; p=0{$\cdot$}0004), driven by fewer myocardial infarctions and ischaemia-driven  revascularisations in the QFR-guided group than in the angiography-guided group.  INTERPRETATION: In FAVOR III China, among patients undergoing PCI, a QFR-guided  strategy of lesion selection improved 1-year clinical outcomes compared with  standard angiography guidance.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was  to assess for the first time the safety and efficacy of a novel biolimus-coated  balloon (BCB) in patients with small-vessel coronary disease. METHODS: In a  prospective trial conducted at 10 centers in China, 212 patients with  small-vessel native coronary disease (reference vessel diameter 2.0-2.75~mm,  lesion length~{$\leq$}25~mm) were randomized to receive a BCB or an uncoated balloon.  The primary endpoint was in-segment late lumen loss at 9~months. RESULTS: In the  per-protocol population, angiographic late lumen loss at 9~months was 0.16 {\textpm}  0.29~mm in the BCB group vs 0.30 {\textpm} 0.35~mm with the plain balloon (P~=~0.001).  Late luminal enlargement (positive remodeling) occurred in 29.7\% of patients in  the BCB group vs 9.8\% of patients with plain balloons (P~=~0.007). In the full  analysis set population, after 12~months, target lesion failure rates were 6.7\%  in the BCB group vs 13.9\% with the plain balloon (HR: 0.47; 95\%~CI: 0.19-1.16),  and rates of the patient-oriented clinical outcome were 14.3\% with the BCB vs  21.8\% with the plain balloon (HR: 0.64; 95\%~CI: 0.33-1.24). CONCLUSIONS: In this  first-in-human study, a novel BCB showed superior efficacy to plain balloon  angioplasty in patients with small-vessel coronary disease undergoing  percutaneous coronary intervention.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonrheumatic valvular diseases are common; however, no studies have estimated their global or national burden. As part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), degenerative mitral valve disease, and other nonrheumatic valvular diseases were estimated for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. METHODS: Vital registration data, epidemiologic survey data, and administrative hospital data were used to estimate disease burden using the Global Burden of Disease Study modeling framework, which ensures comparability across locations. Geospatial statistical methods were used to estimate disease for all countries, because data on nonrheumatic valvular diseases are extremely limited for some regions of the world, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Results accounted for estimated level of disease severity as well as the estimated availability of valve repair or replacement procedures. DALYs and other measures of health-related burden were generated for both sexes and each 5-year age group, location, and year from 1990 to 2017. RESULTS: Globally, CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease caused 102\,700 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 82\,700-107\,900) and 35\,700 (95\% UI, 30\,500-42\,500) deaths, and 12.6 million (95\% UI, 11.4 million-13.8 million) and 18.1 million (95\% UI, 17.6 million-18.6 million) prevalent cases existed in 2017, respectively. A total of 2.5 million (95\% UI, 2.3 million-2.8 million) DALYs were estimated as caused by nonrheumatic valvular diseases globally, representing 0.10\% (95\% UI, 0.09\%-0.11\%) of total lost health from all diseases in 2017. The number of DALYs increased for CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease between 1990 and 2017 by 101\% (95\% UI, 79\%-117\%) and 35\% (95\% UI, 23\%-47\%), respectively. There is significant geographic variation in the prevalence, mortality rate, and overall burden of these diseases, with highest age-standardized DALY rates of CAVD estimated for high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: These global and national estimates demonstrate that CAVD and degenerative mitral valve disease are important causes of disease burden among older adults. Efforts to clarify modifiable risk factors and improve access to valve interventions are necessary if progress is to be made toward reducing, and eventually eliminating, the burden of these highly treatable diseases.},

However, serial physiological  assessments after drug-coated balloons (DCB) have not been investigated. METHODS:  This prospective observational single-center study evaluated 50 lesions that  underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) with DCB and a 9-months angiographical and OCT follow-up.  Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) were  measured immediately (FFR0m and, iFR0m) and 15~min (FFR15m and iFR15m) after DCB,  and the difference (dif-FFR and, dif-iFR) was calculated. The iFR gradients  during lesions treated with DCB were measured. For OCT and quantitative coronary  angiography (QCA) data, delta values were calculated. RESULTS: At index PCI,  three lesions were needed for bailout stenting. At follow-up, 47 lesions were  divided into two groups according to the delta minimal lumen area (MLA) on OCT:  late lumen enlargement (LLE) (n~=~29) and non-LLE (n~=~18). In LLE group, FFR15m  and iFR15m were significantly high (0.90~{\textpm}~0.03 vs. 0.85~{\textpm}~0.07, p~{$<~$}0.001,  0.97~{\textpm}~0.02 vs. 0.92~{\textpm}~0.10, p~=~0.008, respectively) and \%AS on OCT, dif-FFR and  dif-iFR were significantly low (38.5\% (33.6, 42.3) vs. 45.1\% (38.9, 54.6),  p~=~0.03, -0.001~{\textpm}~0.006 vs. 0.036~{\textpm}~0.032, p~{$<~$}0.001, -0.002~{\textpm}~0.008 vs.  0.019~{\textpm}~0.017, p~{$<~$}0.001, respectively) compared with non-LLE group. However,  there were no significant differences in FFR0m, iFR0m, or any other OCT or QCA  data. CONCLUSIONS: Post-physiological assessment and a decrease in physiological  indices in the first 15~min after PCI are important for treating de novo lesions  using the DCB strategy.},

The long-term clinical performance comparison  between PF-SES and the latest generation polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stents  (SES), particularly regarding intravascular imaging assessment and in the type 2  diabetes mellitus (DM) population, remains unexplored. METHODS: We conducted a  retrospective study involving 2646 diabetes patients meeting coronary artery  disease (CAD) criteria underwent coronary stents in the real-world. All patients  were divided into the PF-SES group and the SES group. Optical coherence  tomography (OCT) was used to evaluate the imaging characteristics of in-stent  reendothelialization. Patient information between the two groups was  systematically compared in hospital and at 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: In terms of  basic characteristics, the proportion of current smoker and stable angina  patients in the PF-SES group was significantly higher than that in the SES group.  The PF-SES group exhibited significantly higher rate of left anterior descending  (LAD) lesion and more stents per patients compared to the SES group. The value of  minimum lumen area (MLA), neointimal area (NA) and neointimal thickness (NT) were  higher in the PF-SES group. Additionally, the occurrence rates of heterogeneous,  lipid layer, intimal tears, thrombi, and micro-vessels were notably lower in the  PF-SES group compared to the SES group. A higher all-cause mortality was observed  in the SES cohort. DISCUSSION: PF-SES could effectively improve in-stent  reendothelialization in patients with type 2 DM, with positive effects on  survival rate and may, therefore, be considered as an alternative treatment  option for improving clinical long-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valve replacement combined with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation (VR\,+\,CABG) is usually associated with higher mortality and complication rates. Currently, angiography remains the most commonly used approach to guide CABG. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a quantitative flow ratio (QFR)-guided strategy can improve the clinical outcomes of VR\,+\,CABG. METHODS: Patients (n\,=\,536) treated by VR\,+\,CABG between January 2018 and December 2021 were retrospectively assessed. In 116 patients, all lesions were revascularized entirely based on QFR (the QFR-guided group), whereas in 420 patients, all lesions were revascularized entirely based on angiography (the angiography-guided group). To minimize selection bias between the 2 groups, propensity score matching was performed at a ratio of 1:2. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 1-year, which was defined as a composite of cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), any repeat revascularization, and stroke. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed in the baseline clinical characteristics between the QFR-guided and angiography-guided groups after propensity score matching. The mean age of all patients was 66.2 years [standard deviation (SD)\,=\,8.3], 370 (69\%) were men, the mean body-mass index of the population was 24.8\>kg/m(2) (SD\,=\,4.5), 129 (24\%) had diabetes, and 229 (43\%) had angina symptoms. When compared with the angiography-guided group, the QFR-guided group had a significantly shorter operative time (323\,{\textpm}\,60\>min vs. 343\,{\textpm}\,71\>min, P\,=\,0.010), extra corporal circulation time (137\,{\textpm}\,38\>min vs. 155\,{\textpm} 62\>min, P\,=\,0.004), clamp time (73\,{\textpm}\,19\>min vs. 81\,{\textpm}\,18\>min, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), and less intraoperative bleeding volume (640\,{\textpm}\,148\>ml vs. 682\,{\textpm}\,166\>ml, P\,=\,0.022). Compared with the angiography-guided group, the 1-year MACCE was significantly lower in the QFR-guided group (6.9\% vs. 14.7\%, P\,=\,0.036, hazard ratio\,=\,0.455, 95\% confidence interval: 0.211-0.982). CONCLUSION: Our results raise the hypothesis that among patients who undergo VR\,+ CABG, QFR-guided strategy is associated with optimized surgical procedure and a superior clinical outcome, as evidenced by a lower rate of MACCE at 1-year compared with conventional angiography-guided strategy.},

ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a large language model, holds the potential to provide professional yet patient-friendly support. We aimed to examine the accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT in answering questions regarding knowledge, management, and emotional support for cirrhosis and HCC. METHODS: ChatGPT's responses to 164 questions were independently graded by two transplant hepatologists and resolved by a third reviewer. The performance of ChatGPT was also assessed using two published questionnaires and 26 questions formulated from the quality measures of cirrhosis management. Finally, its emotional support capacity was tested. RESULTS: We showed that ChatGPT regurgitated extensive knowledge of cirrhosis (79.1\% correct) and HCC (74.0\% correct), but only small proportions (47.3\% in cirrhosis, 41.1\% in HCC) were labeled as comprehensive. The performance was better in basic knowledge, lifestyle, and treatment than in the domains of diagnosis and preventive medicine. For the quality measures, the model answered 76.9\% of questions correctly but failed to specify decision-making cut-offs and treatment durations. ChatGPT lacked knowledge of regional guidelines variations, such as HCC screening criteria. However, it provided practical and multifaceted advice to patients and caregivers regarding the next steps and adjusting to a new diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We analyzed the areas of robustness and limitations of ChatGPT's responses on the management of cirrhosis and HCC and relevant emotional support. ChatGPT may have a role as an adjunct informational tool for patients and physicians to improve outcomes.},

However, these models also pose a danger of perpetuating biases and delivering incorrect medical diagnoses, which can have a direct, harmful impact on medical care. We aimed to assess whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases that impact its use in health care. METHODS: Using the Azure OpenAI application interface, this model evaluation study tested whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases and examined the impact of such biases on four potential applications of LLMs in the clinical domain-namely, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, clinical plan generation, and subjective patient assessment. We conducted experiments with prompts designed to resemble typical use of GPT-4 within clinical and medical education applications. We used clinical vignettes from NEJM Healer and from published research on implicit bias in health care. GPT-4 estimates of the demographic distribution of medical conditions were compared with true US prevalence estimates. Differential diagnosis and treatment planning were evaluated across demographic groups using standard statistical tests for significance between groups. FINDINGS: We found that GPT-4 did not appropriately model the demographic diversity of medical conditions, consistently producing clinical vignettes that stereotype demographic presentations. The differential diagnoses created by GPT-4 for standardised clinical vignettes were more likely to include diagnoses that stereotype certain races, ethnicities, and genders. Assessment and plans created by the model showed significant association between demographic attributes and recommendations for more expensive procedures as well as differences in patient perception. INTERPRETATION: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and transparent bias assessments of LLM tools such as GPT-4 for intended use cases before they are integrated into clinical care. We discuss the potential sources of these biases and potential mitigation strategies before clinical implementation. FUNDING: Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg.},

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were used to retrieve literature through 11th May 2019. Standardized weighted mean difference (SMD) and relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI), P-value, and I(2) value were used to assess the strength of the association in this meta-analysis. Outcomes included platelet reactivity, high residual platelet reactivity (HRPR), ticagrelor maximum concentration (Cmax), ticagrelor area under curve (AUC), death rate, reinfarction rate, stroke, stent thrombosis, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) hemorrhage, dyspnea, emesis, contrast-induced nephropathy, and pulmonary edema. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles were included in this study, containing 5688 patients (morphine group: n~=~2014, control group: n~=~3674). Results illustrated that the morphine group had a higher platelet reactivity (SMD: 0.834, 95\%CI: 0.483-1.186, P~{$<~$}0.001) and HRPR rate (RR: 1.994, 95\%CI: 1.536-2.588, P~{$<~$}0.001) than the control group, while the Cmax of ticagrelor (WMD: -481.838, 95\%CI: -841.242-122.434, P~=~0.009) was lower than that of the control group. The death rate of the morphine group was lower than that in the control group (RR: 0.561, 95\%CI: 0.337-0.933, P~=~0.026). The morphine group had a higher emesis rate than the control group (RR: 4.486, 95\%CI: 2.263-8.891, P~{$<~$}0.001).

METHODS: Prefecture-level data of STEMI patients before the  implementation of a regional network were analysed retrospectively. Drivers of  inequality were identified from six social determinants of health, namely area of  residence, ethnicity, sex, age, education and occupation. Outcomes of STEMI care  included timely presentation, reperfusion therapy, timely reperfusion therapy,  heart failure, inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and  various intervals of ischaemic time. RESULTS: A total of 376 STEMI patients in  the research area before implementation of the STEMI network were included.  Compared with urban residents, rural patients were significantly less likely to  have timely presentation (odds ratio [OR]=0.47, 95\% CI: 0.28-0.80, P=.004) and  timely reperfusion therapy (OR=0.32, 95\% CI: 0.14-0.70, P=.005). Rural residents  were less likely to present to hospital promptly than urban residents (HR=0.65,  95\% CI=0.52-0.82, P{$<$}.001). In the first 3 hours of percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI) reperfusion delay and first 6 hours of total ischaemic time,  rural patients had a significantly lower probability to receive prompt PCI  (hazard ratio [HR]=0.40, 95\% CI: 0.29-0.54, P{$<$}.001) and reperfusion therapy  (HR=0.37, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.56, P{$<$}.001) compared to urban patients. CONCLUSION:  Rural residents were a major vulnerable group before implementation of the  regional STEMI network. No obvious inequalities in ethnicity, sex, age, education  or occupation existed in STEMI care in Chuxiong Prefecture of China.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug eluting stents (DESs) made with biodegradable polymer have been developed in an attempt to improve clinical outcomes. However, the impact of  biodegradable polymers on clinical events and stent thrombosis (ST) remains  controversial. METHODS: We searched Medline, the Cochrane Library and other  internet sources, without language or date restrictions for articles comparing  clinical outcomes between biodegradable polymer DES and durable polymer DES.  Safety endpoints were ST (definite, definite/probable), mortality, and myocardial  infarction (MI). Efficacy endpoints were major adverse cardiac event (MACE) and  target lesion revascularization (TLR). RESULTS: We identified 15 randomized  controlled trials (n = 17 068) with a weighted mean follow-up of 20.6 months.  There was no statistical difference in the incidence of definite/probable ST  between durable polymer- and biodegradable polymer- DES; relative risk (RR) 0.83;  95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-1.11; P = 0.22. Biodegradable polymer DES had  similar rates of definite ST (RR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.66-1.33, P = 0.72), mortality (RR  0.94, 95\% CI 0.82-1.09, P = 0.43), MI (RR 1.08, 95\% CI 0.92-1.26. P = 0.35), MACE  (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.91-1.09, P = 0.85), and TLR (RR, 0.94, 95\% CI 0.83-1.06, P =  0.30) compared with durable polymer DES. Based on the stratified analysis of the  included trials, the treatment effect on definite ST was different at different  follow-up times: {$\leq$} 1 year favoring durable polymer DES and {$>$}1 year favoring  biodegradable polymer DES. CONCLUSIONS: Biodegradable polymer DES has similar  safety and efficacy for treating patients with coronary artery disease compared  with durable polymer DES. Further data with longer term follow-up are warranted  to confirm the potential benefits of biodegradable polymer DES.},
